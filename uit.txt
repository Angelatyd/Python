 ADVISORS CORE EQUITY STRATEGY PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return primarily through
capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its
objective.
                                        

                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return, primarily through
capital appreciation, by investing in a portfolio of stocks of companies that
we<F1>* believe can take advantage of the current economic landscape.  The
securities were selected by analyzing factors including market capitalization,
economic sectors, revenues, revenue growth, earnings, earnings growth, balance
sheet strength and valuation.  In selecting stocks for the portfolio, we sought
to include both growth and value stocks and provide diversification across
market capitalizations and multiple industry sectors.  The trust may be
appropriate as a core position in the equity allocation portion of an investor's
overall portfolio.
  

                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  THE TRUST MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  These
   securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than
   securities of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have
   limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less
   publicly available information.

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,
   the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same securities
   even if their market value declines.

2     Investment Summary


                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:
  
  *  to own a defined portfolio of stocks.
  
  *  to pursue a long-term, growth-oriented investment strategy that includes
     investment in subsequent portfolios, if available.
  
  *  the potential for capital appreciation.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in common
     stocks.
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the trust's strategy.
  
  *  seek current income or capital preservation.

                                   =======         =======

  
  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on
November 20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit
and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less
than or equal to $10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public
offering price per unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial
sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $268
          3 years             $822
          5 years           $1,401
          10 years          $2,970
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $398,973 and $0,
     respectively.

(3)  This is a security issued by a foreign company.

     Common Stocks comprise 100.00% of the investments in the trust, broken down

 BAHL &GAYNOR INCOME GROWTH PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide high current and growing dividend income with
capital appreciation as a secondary objective.  There is no assurance the trust
will achieve its objective.
  
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of high-
quality companies that have historically paid dividends and demonstrated steady
earnings and dividend growth selected by Bahl & Gaynor, Inc. (the "Portfolio
Consultant").  Although the trust's portfolio may include securities of
companies with a range of market capitalizations, it consists primarily of
securities of companies categorized as large capitalization by the Portfolio
Consultant as of the trust's inception.  The Portfolio Consultant defines large
capitalization companies to be those with market capitalizations of $10 billion
or higher.  Weightings of individual sectors were based on the Portfolio
Consultant's assessment of company fundamentals, valuations and overall economic
conditions.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  NEITHER WE<F1>* NOR THE PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT ACTIVELY MANAGES THE PORTFOLIO.
   Except in limited circumstances, the trust will hold, and continue to buy,
   shares of the same securities even if their market value declines.
  
                              PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT
  
  The Portfolio Consultant, Bahl & Gaynor, Inc., is a registered investment
adviser.  The Portfolio Consultant was founded in 1990 and is owned entirely by
its investment professionals.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  The Portfolio
Consultant makes no representations that the portfolio will achieve the
investment objectives or will be profitable or suitable for any particular
potential investor.  The sponsor did not select the securities for the trust.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant and/or its affiliates may use the list of securities
in its independent capacity as an investment adviser and distribute this
information to various individuals and entities.  The Portfolio Consultant
and/or its affiliates may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect
transactions in the securities held by the trust.  This may have an adverse
effect on the prices of the securities.  This also may have an impact on the
price the trust pays for the securities and the price received upon unit
redemptions or liquidation of the securities.  The Portfolio Consultant and/or
its affiliates also may issue reports and makes recommendations on securities,
which may include the securities in the trust.
  
  Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor the sponsor manages the trust.  Opinions
expressed by the Portfolio Consultant are not necessarily those of the sponsor,
and may not actually come to pass.  The trust will pay the Portfolio Consultant
a fee for selecting the trust's portfolio.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on
November 20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit
and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less
than or equal to $10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public
offering price per unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial
sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $250
          3 years             $767
          5 years           $1,311
          10 years          $2,793
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $180,368 and $0,
     respectively.

---------------------------------------------
 BLUE CHIP PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


  

                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return primarily through
capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its
objective.
  

                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return primarily through
capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of common stocks of companies
that we<F1>* consider to be "blue chip" companies.
  
  In selecting the stocks, we begin with a universe of well-known and
established domestic companies that have market capitalizations in excess of
five billion dollars.  We then eliminate companies that we believe are not
market leaders with strong reputations for providing high quality goods and
services.  We base our final selections on economic sector, financial strength,
past earnings and revenue growth tends, projected earnings and revenue growth as
well as current valuation.
  

                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.

*  THE ISSUER OF A SECURITY MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS
   IN THE FUTURE.  This may reduce the level of dividends the trust receives
   which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall.

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,
   the trust will generally hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same
   securities even if their market value declines.

<F1>*  "AAM," "we" and related terms mean Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
       trust sponsor, unless the context clearly suggests otherwise.

                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:
  
  *  to own a defined portfolio of stocks of larger, established companies.
  
  *  the potential for capital appreciation.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in common
     stocks.
  
  *  seek high current income or capital preservation.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning November
20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit and is
paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be approximately
three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less than or equal to
$10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public offering price per
unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $264
          3 years             $811
          5 years           $1,384
          10 years          $2,943
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

---------------------------------------------
 DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return.  There is no assurance
the trust will achieve its objective.
  
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust consists of stocks selected by Eugene E. Peroni of Peroni Portfolio
Advisors, Inc. (the "Portfolio Consultant") through application of his
proprietary method of technical analysis, the Peroni Method(R), historical
quantitative analysis and fundamental analysis.  Mr. Peroni initially screened
stocks based on the following criteria:
  
  *  companies with a longer-term history of paying dividends with special
     consideration to those companies that have historically increased
     their dividends;
     
  *  companies with current annual dividend yields of 2.5% or higher;
     
  *  companies with cash flows that appear sufficient for such company to
     continue to pay dividends; and
     
  *  companies with good longer-term earnings growth prospects.
  
  Mr. Peroni narrowed this universe of stocks through application of the Peroni
Method(R).  From these stocks, Mr. Peroni selected a final portfolio focusing on
financial strength, prospects for revenue and earnings growth and sustainability
of the dividend, among other criteria.  Dividends may be an important component
to total return.
  
  Eugene E. Peroni Jr. has regularly published his insights in reports offering
stock market forecasts and specific stock recommendations for both short and
longer-term investments.  Mr. Peroni regularly appears on CNBC, CBS MarketWatch,
Nightly Business Report, Fox Business News  and Bloomberg Radio, and has been
quoted in publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, U.S.
News and World Report and Investors Business Daily.
  
  Mr. Peroni began training in the field of technical research at age 16 with
his father, Eugene E. Peroni, Sr., who founded the Peroni Method(R) more than 50
years ago.  Mr. Peroni has over 40 years of experience in his field.  The Peroni
Method(R) uses a bottom-up approach, primarily emphasizing the technical merits
of individual stocks.
  
  Mr. Peroni has a library of approximately 1,000 hand-charted stocks that is
the result of extensive technical research and is regularly refreshed to include
new opportunities gleaned through ticker tape analysis, news outlets, corporate
developments and practical observations.  Charts with attractive price
architecture are noted and stocks are ranked and screened on a regular basis.
Historical characteristics are analyzed for price and volume shifts and
evaluations are made using money flow and relative strength trends.  Sector
relative strength is then determined by unbiased groupings of attractive stocks.
Portfolio construction progresses as weightings are determined by analyzing
individual stock price behavior, economic factors, monetary trends,
psychological oscillators and investor psychology.  Those stocks with the best
technical characteristics in strong or emerging leadership sectors are
candidates for inclusion in the portfolio while also taking into consideration
appropriate diversification.
  
  The Peroni Method(R) is a bottom-up approach to stock selection that is
primarily based on technical analysis.  The methodology examines a stock's price
architecture, accumulation and distribution trends and relative strength
patterns, among other more subtle trading characteristics.  This information is
partly gathered and analyzed through hand drawn point and figure charts which
have been a part of the methodology for over half a century.  While the Peroni
Method(R) is primarily focused on the technical characteristics of individual
stocks, economic, monetary, geopolitical and sentiment factors at play in the
market place are also incorporated to identify leading stocks and sectors.
  
  Technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis, which generally
involves financial scrutiny of the issuing company and considers such factors as
earnings projections, P/E ratios, cash flow and other balance sheet data.  The
Peroni Method(R) may be an investment alternative to fundamental analysis.  Mr.
Peroni believes

that technical factors can help identify industry sector relative strength
patterns that may play an important role in investment success.  The methodology
allows an unconstrained approach to stock selection, spanning all market caps
and investment styles, i.e. growth and value.
  
  The Peroni Method(R) examines numerous technical, psychological and
fundamental data.  The data may include:
  
  *  a stock's historical price architecture
     
  *  net money flow trends in individual stocks
     
  *  the relative behavior of a stock's price performance compared to other
     stocks in the same sector
     
  *  sentiment readings such as the volatility index
     
  *  fiscal and monetary factors
     
  *  geopolitical events and their impact on specific sectors
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  THE TRUST IS CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND
   SERVICES COMPANIES.  Negative developments in this sector will affect the
   value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified
   investment.

*  THE TRUST MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  These
   securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than
   securities of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have
   limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less
   publicly available information.

*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
   circumstances, the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same
   securities even if their market value declines.

                              PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT

  The Portfolio Consultant, Peroni Portfolio Advisors, Inc., is an investment
adviser registered in Pennsylvania.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  The Portfolio
Consultant makes no representations that the portfolio will achieve the
investment objectives or will be profitable or suitable for any particular
potential investor.  The sponsor did not select the securities for the trust.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant and/or its affiliates may use the list of securities
in its independent capacity as an investment adviser and distribute this
information to various individuals and entities.  The Portfolio Consultant
and/or its affiliates may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect
transactions in the securities held by the trust.  This may have an adverse
effect on the prices of the securities.  This also may have an impact on the
price the trust pays for the securities and the price received upon unit
redemptions or liquidation of the securities.  The Portfolio Consultant and/or
its affiliates also may issue reports and makes recommendations on securities,
which may include the securities in the trust.
  
   Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor the sponsor manages the trust.
Opinions expressed by the Portfolio Consultant are not necessarily those of the
sponsor, and may not actually come to pass.  The trust will pay the Portfolio
Consultant a fee for selecting the trust's portfolio.  The trust will also pay a
license fee for the use of certain service marks, trademarks, trade names and/or
other property of the Portfolio Consultant.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on
November 20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit
and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less
than or equal to $10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public
offering price per unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial
sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $266
          3 years             $818
          5 years           $1,396
          10 years          $2,967
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase securities.  The value
     of each security is based on the most recent closing sale price of each
     security as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
     on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In accordance
     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $148,603 and $0,
     respectively.

(3)  This is a security issued by a foreign company.

     Common stocks comprise 100.00% of the investments in the trust, broken down

---------------------------------------------
 DIVIDEND SUSTAINABILITY PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return through dividend
income.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its objective.
  
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of
common stocks of primarily domestic companies.  The portfolio was selected by
Hartford Investment Management Company ("HIMCO").
  
  HIMCO sought primarily to select high quality U.S. stocks with above average
dividend yields and the potential to increase dividend payments by considering a
broad universe of companies within the Russell 3000(R) Index for inclusion in
the trust's portfolio.  HIMCO used a structured quantitative approach combined
with fundamental oversight.  HIMCO's quantitative approach sought to identify
companies within various industry sectors possessing attractive fundamentals,
such as solid balance sheets, high quality earnings and attractive growth
prospects.  HIMCO reviewed final selections for the trust's portfolio to assess
the impact of recent events (including management issues, legal proceedings and
future mergers or acquisitions) on each stock's prospects.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE ISSUER OF A SECURITY MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS
   IN THE FUTURE.  This may reduce the level of dividends the trust receives
   which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.

*  THE TRUST INVESTS IN SECURITIES SELECTED BY HIMCO.  In the event that HIMCO
   incorrectly assesses an issuer's prospects for growth or if HIMCO's
   judgment about how other investors will value an issuer's growth is wrong,
   then the price of an issuer's stock may decrease or not increase to the
   level anticipated.

*  THE TRUST MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  These
   securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than
   securities of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have
   limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less
   publicly available information.

*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
   circumstances, the trust will generally hold, and continue to buy, shares
   of the same securities even if their market value declines.


--------------------
<F1>*  "AAM," "we" and related terms mean Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
       trust sponsor, unless the context clearly suggests otherwise.


22     Investment Summary


                              PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT
  
  The portfolio consultant, Hartford Investment Management Company, is a
registered investment adviser.
  
  HIMCO is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  HIMCO selected a list of
securities to be included in the portfolio based on the criteria provided by the
sponsor. HIMCO makes no representations that the portfolio will achieve the
investment objectives or will be profitable or suitable for any particular
potential investor.  The sponsor did not select the securities for the trust.
  
  HIMCO may use the list of securities in its independent capacity as an
investment adviser and distribute this information to various individuals and
entities.  HIMCO may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect transactions
in the securities held by the trust.  This may have an adverse effect on the
prices of the securities.  This also may have an impact on the price the trust
pays for the securities and the price received upon unit redemptions or
liquidation of the securities.  HIMCO may also issue reports and make
recommendations on securities, which may include the securities in the trust.
  
  Neither HIMCO nor the sponsor manages the trust.  Opinions expressed by HIMCO
are not necessarily those of the sponsor, and may not actually prove correct.
The trust will pay HIMCO a fee for selecting the trust's portfolio.  The trust
will also pay a license fee for the use of certain service marks, trademarks,
trade names and/or other property of HIMCO.

                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:
  
  *  to own a portfolio of stocks of primarily domestic companies.
  
  *  the potential for above average total return through dividend income.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in common
     stocks.
  
  *  seek capital appreciation or capital preservation.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning November
20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit and is
paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be approximately
three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less than or equal to
$10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public offering price per
unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $268
          3 years             $824
          5 years           $1,405
          10 years          $2,977
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase securities.  The value
     of each security is based on the most recent closing sale price of each
     security as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
     on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In accordance
     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $148,611 and $0,
     respectively.

(3)  This is a non-income producing security.

(4)  This is a security issued by a foreign company that trades on a U.S.
     securities exchange.

     Common stocks comprise 100.00% of the investments in the trust, broken down
     by country of organization as set forth below:

26     Investment Summary


---------------------------------------------
 THE DOW(R) VALUE TEN PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return through dividend income
and capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its
objective.
                                        
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to provide total return, through dividend income and capital
appreciation, by investing in a portfolio consisting of the 10 stocks with the
highest dividend yield chosen from among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average(SM) ("DJIA(SM)") as of August 13, 2018.  The stocks are held
in approximately equal dollar amounts as of the trust's inception.
  
  Please note that the strategy was applied to select the portfolio at a
particular time.  If we<F1>* create additional units of the trust after the
trust's inception date, the trust will purchase the securities originally
selected by applying the strategy.  This is true even if a later application of
the strategy would have resulted in the selection of different securities.  We
disregard any stock in the DJIA(SM) where the U.S. government or any of its
agencies can exercise any veto power over any current or future dividends,
whether common or preferred, to be distributed in connection with such stock.
In such cases, we will automatically select the next highest dividend yielding
stock in the DJIA(SM).  In addition, companies which, based on publicly
available information as of two business days prior to the date of this
prospectus, are the target of an announced business acquisition which are
expected to happen within six months of the date of this prospectus have been
excluded from the universe of securities from which the trust's securities are
selected.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  THE TRUST IS CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES IN THE HEALTH
   CARE SECTOR.  Negative developments in this sector will affect the value of
   your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified
   investment.

*  THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT SUFFICIENTLY CORRESPOND TO PUBLISHED
   HYPOTHETICAL BACK-TESTED PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY.
   This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the
   weightings of securities in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of
   the trust offering or timing of your investment, and trust expenses.
   Hypothetical back-tested performance is not actual past performance of this
   or any trust.  Hypothetical back-tested performance is based on application
   of a trust's investment strategy as of a particular time.

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,
   the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same securities
   even if their market value declines.

                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:
  
  *  to own a defined portfolio of stocks selected using dividend-oriented
     criteria.
  
  *  the potential to receive dividend income and capital appreciation.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in common
     stocks.
  
  *  are uncomfortable investing in stocks selected using dividend-oriented
     criteria.
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the trust's strategy.

  *  seek capital preservation.

paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be approximately
three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less than or equal to
$10, you will not pay an initial sales fee. When the public offering price per
unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial sales fee.
                                        
                                     EXAMPLE
                                        
  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $253
          3 years             $778
          5 years           $1,330
          10 years          $2,833
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase securities.  The value
     of each security is based on the most recent closing sale price of each
     security as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
     on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In accordance
     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $148,483 and $0,
     respectively.

                HYPOTHETICAL BACK-TESTED PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
  
  The following table compares hypothetical back-tested performance information
for the strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the
DJIA(SM) in each of the years listed below (and as of the most recent month).
These hypothetical back-tested returns do not guarantee and should not be used
to predict future performance of the trust.  Returns from the trust will differ
from the hypothetical strategy returns for several reasons, including:
  
     *  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust
        on the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur;
     
     *  strategy returns are for calendar years (and through the most recent
        month), while trusts begin and end on various dates;
     
     *  extraordinary market events that we have not expected to be repeated
        and may have affected performance;
     
     *  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year;
     
     *  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in
        all securities comprising its strategy; and
     
     *  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from
        the closing prices used in buying and selling units.
  
  You should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any
index, and it is not expected that it will do so.  In fact, the trust's strategy
underperformed its comparative index in certain years and we cannot guarantee
that the trust will outperform its related index over the life of the trust or
over consecutive rollover periods, if available.

  Hypothetical back-tested performance is no guarantee of future results.
Hypothetical back-tested performance of the Dow(R) Value Ten Strategy securities
(the "strategy securities") is hypothetical (and does not represent any actual
trust), is shown for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to indicate
the future performance of any investment, including the trust.  The strategy
securities for a given year consist of the securities selected by applying the
strategy as of the beginning of the period (and not the date the trust actually
sells units).  The hypothetical back-tested performance of the strategy
securities for 0 of the 11 periods shown are the result of extraordinary market
events and are not expected to be repeated.
  
  Securities are selected through application of a strategy at a particular
point in time and if a security which is a component of a strategy is merged out
of existence, de-listed or suffers a similar fate during the period in which the
strategy performance is being measured, such security will


30     Investment Summary


not be replaced by another security during that period. The strategy is not
rebalanced during each one year period and as a result the stocks used for
determining hypothetical back-tested performance will not take into account
subsequent changes to the indexes used as a starting point for the strategy.
  
  Total return represents the sum of the change in market value of each group
of securities between the first and last trading day of a period plus the total
dividends paid on each group of securities during such period divided by the
opening market value of each group of securities as of the first trading day of
a period.  Total return figures shown above in the table assume that all
dividends are reinvested semi-annually.  Strategy figures reflect the deduction
of sales charges and expenses but have not been reduced by estimated brokerage
commissions and other transaction costs paid by the trust in acquiring
securities or any taxes incurred by investors.
  
  Hypothetical back-tested returns are hypothetical, meaning that they do not
represent actual trading, and, thus, may not reflect material economic and
market factors, such as liquidity constraints, that may have had an impact on
actual decision making. The hypothetical back-tested performance is the
retroactive application of the strategy designed with the full benefit of
hindsight.
  
  The trust's strategy begins with the DJIA(SM).  The DJIA(SM) consists of 30
U.S. stocks chosen by the editors of The Wall Street Journal as being
representative of the broad market and of American industry.  Changes in the
component stocks of the DJIA(SM) are made entirely by the editors of The Wall
Street Journal without consulting the companies, the stock exchange or any
official agency.  For the sake of continuity, changes are made rarely.

---------------------------------------------
 ENERGY OPPORTUNITIES PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return primarily through
capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its
objective.
                                        
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return primarily through
capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of stocks
within the energy sector.  Energy companies are engaged in the exploration,
production, marketing, refining and/or transportation of oil and gas products,
coal and other consumable fuels and/or the construction or provision of oil
rigs, drilling equipment and other energy related service and equipment,
including seismic data collection.  We<F1>* selected the trust portfolio
securities through an analysis based on market capitalization, dividend levels
and sustainability, revenues, revenue growth, earnings, earnings growth and
valuation.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  THE TRUST IS CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES IN THE ENERGY
   SECTOR.  Negative developments in the energy sector will affect the value
   of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified
   investment.

*  THE TRUST MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  These
   securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than
   securities of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have
   limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less
   publicly available information.

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,
   the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same securities
   even if their market value declines.

                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:
  
  *  to own a defined portfolio of stocks of energy companies.
  
  *  the potential for capital appreciation.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in common
     stocks.
  
  *  are uncomfortable investing in energy companies.
  
  *  seek current income or capital preservation.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning November
20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit and is
paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be approximately
three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less than or equal to
$10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public offering price per
unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $264
          3 years             $811
          5 years           $1,384
          10 years          $2,943
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase securities.  The value
     of each security is based on the most recent closing sale price of each
     security as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
     on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In accordance
     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $148,644 and
     $(20), respectively.

(3)  This is a security issued by a foreign company.

     Common stocks comprise 100.00% of the investments in the trust, broken down
     by country of organization of the issuer as set forth below:

 EUROPEAN SELECT PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return.  There is no assurance
the trust will achieve its objective.
  
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a diversified
portfolio of stocks of companies organized in Europe selected by Cyrus J.
Lawrence LLC (the "Portfolio Consultant").  Portfolio Consultant sought to
identify stocks of companies exhibiting improving and sustainable earnings
supported by attractive relative stock valuations.  Companies selected for
inclusion in the portfolio are expected by the Portfolio Consultant to be
leaders in their respective industry, dominant regionally and recognized as
either established or emerging global competitors.  The trust's "European
Select" strategy has a dual focus of targeting companies that will be potential
beneficiaries of global accelerating economic growth but also companies geared
towards a sustainable European recovery.
  
  The trust's portfolio was selected from an investment universe that includes
all equities traded on the recognized registered exchanges of the European
region.  This list includes large, mid and small capitalization stocks
representing a comprehensive cross section of the European economy.  The trust
was constructed using a combination of top-down (macro analysis) and bottom-up
(individual stock selection) criteria.  Starting with a country and industry
matrix, the framework of the portfolio was aligned with the Portfolio
Consultant's macro economic outlook while capturing a cross-section of the
European investment universe.  Once the framework was identified, the trust's
portfolio was selected through comprehensive quantitative screening and
qualitative validation.  The screening process sought to identify stocks of
companies organized in Europe that exhibit superior characteristics according to
multiple factors broken down as growth, valuation and market measures.  Stocks
were selected based on evidence of superior relative earnings growth
expectations coupled with strong balance sheets and the expectation of
accelerating shareholder returns either through increasing dividends and/or
share buybacks.
  
  Under normal circumstances, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets
in stocks of companies organized in European countries.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  SECURITIES OF FOREIGN COMPANIES HELD BY THE TRUST PRESENT RISKS BEYOND THOSE
   OF U.S. ISSUERS.  These risks may include market and political factors
   related to the company's


                                                       Investment Summary     37


   foreign market, international trade conditions, less regulation, smaller or
   less liquid markets, increased volatility, differing accounting practices
   and changes in the value of foreign currencies.

*  THE TRUST IS CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES OF EUROPEAN COMPANIES.  Negative
   developments in Europe will affect the value of your investment more than
   would be the case in a more diversified investment.

*  THE TRUST IS CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND
   SERVICES COMPANIES.  Negative developments in this sector will affect the
   value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified
   investment.

*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
   circumstances, the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same
   securities even if their market value declines.
  
                              PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT
  
  The Portfolio Consultant, Cyrus J. Lawrence LLC, is a registered investment
adviser formed in November 2014.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  The Portfolio
Consultant makes no representations that the portfolio will achieve the
investment objectives or will be profitable or suitable for any particular
potential investor.  The sponsor did not select the securities for the trust.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant and/or its affiliates may use the list of securities
in its independent capacity as an investment adviser and distribute this
information to various individuals and entities.  The Portfolio Consultant
and/or its affiliates may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect
transactions in the securities held by the trust.  This may have an adverse
effect on the prices of the securities.  This also may have an impact on the
price the trust pays for the securities and the price received upon unit
redemptions or liquidation of the securities.  The Portfolio Consultant and/or
its affiliates also may issue reports and makes recommendations on securities,
which may include the securities in the trust.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on
November 20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit
and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less
than or equal to $10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public
offering price per unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial
sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $300
          3 years             $919
          5 years           $1,563
          10 years          $3,286
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase securities.  The value
     of each security is based on the evaluation of each security as of the
     close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day
     prior to the trust's inception date.  Accounting Standards Codification
     820, "Fair Value Measurements" establishes a framework for measuring fair
     value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements in financial
     statements for the trust.  The framework under the standard is comprised of
     a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of
     observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
     measuring fair value.  The standard describes three levels of inputs that
     may be used to measure fair value:

          Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
          liabilities in active markets that the trust has the ability to
          access as of the measurement date.
     
          Level 2:  Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices,
          such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
          prices in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are
          observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
          Certain securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges may be valued
          using indications of fair value provided by an independent pricing
          service to reflect any significant market movements between the
          time the trust values such securities and the earlier closing of
          such non-U.S. markets.  Such fair valuations are categorized as
          Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
     
          Level 3:  Significant unobservable inputs that reflect the trust's
          own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants
          would use in pricing an asset or liability.

     The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily
     an indication of the risk associated with investing those securities.

     Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an
     investment's assigned level as described above.

     The following table summarizes the trust's investments as of the trust's
     inception, based on inputs used to value them:

---------------------------------------------
 INTERNATIONAL HIGH 30 DIVIDEND PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return.  There is no assurance
the trust will achieve its objective.
  
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust invests in a portfolio of stocks of foreign companies selected
using a specialized dividend-oriented strategy that seeks above average total
return.  We<F1>* selected the portfolio as of August 13, 2018 using the
following strategy:
  
*  We begin with the companies listed in the S&P ADR Index.  The S&P ADR Index
   is based on the non-U.S. stocks comprising the S&P Global 1200 Index.  The
   S&P ADR Index is made up of those companies from the S&P Global 1200 Index
   that offer either Level II or Level III American Depositary Receipts
   (ADRs), global shares, or ordinary shares in the case of Canadian equities.
   The S&P Global 1200 Index covers 30 countries and consists of seven
   regional components.

*  From the S&P ADR Index, we select the three securities with the highest
   dividend yields in each of the nine Global Industry Classification Standard
   (GICS(R)) sectors other than the Financials and Real Estate sectors and the
   three securities with the highest dividend yields in the Financials and
   Real Estate GICS(R) sectors combined.  Effectively, after September 1, 2016
   the strategy seeks to treat the Real Estate GICS(R) sector as if it was
   still positioned under the Financials GICS(R) sector (as it was prior to
   September 1, 2016).

*  We select those 30 stocks for the trust's portfolio in approximately equal
   weightings.


  The eleven industry sectors used in the strategy are the GICS(R) sectors
published by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc.  Please note that we applied
the strategy to select the portfolio at a particular time.  If we create
additional units of the trust after the trust's inception date, the trust will
purchase the securities originally selected by applying the strategy.  This is
true even if a later application of the strategy would have resulted in the
selection of different securities.  Effective October 1, 2018 revisions are
being made to the GICS(R) structure including the renaming of the
Telecommunication Services Sector to the Communication Services Sector and the
broadening of that sector to incorporate a number of companies currently
categorized as Consumer Discretionary Sector companies.  Since the portfolio
will not be changed in connection with this change to the GICS(R) structure, it
will impact the portfolio's sector weightings.  In addition, companies which,
based on publicly available information as of two business days prior to the
date of this prospectus, are the target of an announced business combination
which we expect will happen within six months of the date of this prospectus
have been excluded from the universe of securities from which the trust's
securities are selected.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

                                                       Investment Summary     43



*  THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT SUFFICIENTLY CORRESPOND TO PUBLISHED
   HYPOTHETICAL BACK-TESTED PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY.
   This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the
   weightings of securities in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of
   the trust offering or timing of your investment, and trust expenses.
   Hypothetical back-tested performance is not actual past performance of this
   or any trust.  Hypothetical back-tested performance is based on application
   of a trust's investment strategy as of a particular time.

*  SECURITIES OF FOREIGN COMPANIES HELD BY THE TRUST PRESENT RISKS BEYOND THOSE
   OF U.S. ISSUERS.  These risks may include market and political factors
   related to the company's foreign market, international trade conditions,
   less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility,
   differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign
   currencies.

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,
   the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same securities
   even if their market value declines.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on
November 20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit
and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less
than or equal to $10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public
offering price per unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial
sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $265
          3 years             $813
          5 years           $1,388
          10 years          $2,949
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase securities.  The value
     of each security is based on the most recent closing sale price of each
     security as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
     on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In accordance
     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.  All securities are issued by foreign issuers.

     Common stocks comprise 100.00% of the investments in the trust, broken down
     by country of organization as set forth below:

     Australia   3.34%        Belgium           3.29%        Brazil       3.34%
     Canada     13.35%        Chile             3.33%        China        3.38%
     Finland     3.34%        France            3.34%        Japan        6.66%
     Jersey      6.66%        Netherlands       6.68%        Switzerland  3.34%
     Taiwan      3.35%        United Kingdom   36.60%

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $148,531 and
     $(15), respectively.

(3)  Effective October 1, 2018 as part of revisions to the GICS(R) structure,
     this security will be re-classified as part of the new Communication
     Services Sector.

                HYPOTHETICAL BACK-TESTED PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
  
  The following table compares hypothetical back-tested performance information
for the strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the
Standard & Poor's ADR Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in each of the
years listed below (and as of the most recent month end).  These hypothetical
back-tested returns do not guarantee and should not be used to predict future
performance of the trust.  Returns from the trust will differ from the
hypothetical strategy returns for several reasons, including:
  
  *  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on
     the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur;
  
  *  strategy returns are for calendar years (and through the most recent
     month), while trusts begin and end on various dates;
  
  *  extraordinary market events that we have not expected to be repeated and
     may have affected performance;
  
  *  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year;
  
  *  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in
     all securities comprising its strategy; and
  
  *  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the
     closing prices used in buying and selling units.
  
  You should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any
index, and it is not expected that it will do so.  In fact, the trust's strategy
underperformed its comparative indexes in certain years and we cannot guarantee
that the trust will outperform any index over the life of the trust or over
consecutive rollover periods, if available.

  Hypothetical back-tested performance is no guarantee of future results.
Hypothetical back-tested performance of the International High 30 Strategy (the
"strategy securities") is hypothetical (and does not represent any actual
trust), is shown for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to indicate
the future performance of any investment, including the trust.  The strategy
securities for a given year consist of the common stocks selected by applying
the strategy as of the beginning of the period (and not the date the trust
actually sells units).  The hypothetical back-tested performance of the strategy
securities for 1 of the 11 periods shown are the result of extraordinary market
events and are not expected to be repeated.
  
  Securities are selected through application of a strategy at a particular
point in time and if a security which is a component of a strategy is merged out
of existence, de-listed or suffers a similar fate during


48     Investment Summary


the period in which the strategy performance is being measured, such security
will not be replaced by another security during that period. The strategy is not
rebalanced during each one year period and as a result the securities used for
determining hypothetical back-tested performance will not take into account
subsequent changes to the indexes used as a starting point for the strategy.
  
  Prior to the market close on August 31, 2016, there were ten GICS(R) sectors
and after the market close on August 31, 2016, a Real Estate GICS(R) sector was
added, elevating its position from under the Financials GICS(R) sector, bringing
the total number of GICS(R) sectors to eleven.  Prior to August 31, 2016, the
International High 30 Strategy selected three securities from (after the
application of certain screens) each of the then existing ten GICS(R) sectors.
After August 31, 2016, the International High 30 Strategy selects the three
securities from each of the nine GICS(R) sectors other than the Financials and
Real Estate sectors and three additional securities from the Financials and Real
Estate GICS(R) sectors combined (for a total of 30 securities) after the
application of certain screens.  The hypothetical back-tested performance for
2016 and earlier are based on the International High 30 Strategy with ten
GICS(R) sectors.
  
  Total return represents the sum of the change in market value of each group
of securities between the first and last trading day of a period plus the total
dividends paid on each group of stocks during such period divided by the opening
market value of each group of stocks as of the first trading day of a period.
Total return figures shown above in the table assume that all dividends are
reinvested semi-annually.  Strategy figures reflect the deduction of sales
charges and expenses but have not been reduced by estimated brokerage
commissions and other transaction costs paid by the trust in acquiring
securities or any taxes incurred by investors.
  
  Hypothetical back-tested returns are hypothetical, meaning that they do not
represent actual trading, and, thus, may not reflect material economic and
market factors, such as liquidity constraints, that may have had an impact on
actual decision making. The hypothetical back-tested performance is the
retroactive application of the strategy designed with the full benefit of
hindsight.
  
  The trust strategy is based on the S&P ADR Index.  The S&P ADR Index is
designed to track the S&P 700 Index.  The S&P ADR Index only includes securities
that can be traded and settled in the U.S.  The index is made up of those
companies from the S&P 700 Index that offer either Level II or Level III ADRs,
global shares, or ordinary shares in the case of Canadian equities.  (Level II
and III ADRs are listed on U.S. securities exchanges or Nasdaq and must comply
with certain Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements.)  The
S&P 700 Index is a subset of the S&P Global 1200 Index, representing the non-US
segment of global equity markets.  It is the S&P Global 1200 Index excluding the
S&P 500 Index stocks.  The S&P Global 1200 Index is a composite index, comprised
of seven regional and country headline indices, many of which are the accepted
leaders in their local markets.  The S&P Global 1200 Index covers 30 countries
and consists of seven regional components.
  
  The indexes are unmanaged, not subject to fees, and not available for direct
investment.
  
  The strategy is derived from stocks contained in the S&P ADR Index.  S&P Dow
Jones Indices, a division of the S&P Global Inc., publisher of the S&P ADR
Index, is not affiliated with us and has not participated in creating the trust
or selecting the securities for the trust, nor have they reviewed or approved of
any of the information contained herein.

---------------------------------------------
 MINIMUM VOLATILITY EQUITY INCOME PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------

  
                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average dividend income and lower volatility
compared to the broader U.S. equity market with capital appreciation as a
secondary objective.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its
objective.
  
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio
primarily consisting of common stocks of large capitalization companies (defined
as companies with capitalizations within the collective range of the Russell
1000(R) and S&P 500 Indices as of the trust's inception) selected by Hartford
Investment Management Company ("HIMCO").  In selecting the portfolio, HIMCO
sought to achieve the lowest amount of expected volatility compared to the broad
U.S. equity market over the life of the trust subject to a set of reasonable
constraints related to quality and dividend yield designed by HIMCO.  Low
volatility stocks tend to have lower risk profiles than the equity market in
general.  Investing in low volatility stocks may not protect the trust from
market declines and may reduce the trust's participation in market gains.
  
  HIMCO used a structured quantitative approach for its stock selection
focusing on three main characteristics:  minimum volatility, quality and
dividend yield.  From a minimum volatility perspective, the process sought to
identify a portfolio of stocks with lower expected volatility than the broader
U.S. equity market.  This analysis considered a stock's beta, as well as its
idiosyncratic risk determined by HIMCO.  From a quality perspective, stock
selection focused on identifying companies with attractive fundamentals focusing
on solid balance sheets, high quality earnings, and attractive growth prospects
(e.g. margin expansion, asset quality, low leverage, etc.).  This analysis also
considered the impact of potential corporate events that may alter a company's
future fundamentals.  Finally, from a dividend yield perspective, the process
focused on stocks of companies with above average dividend yield.  Final stock
selection was based primarily on the overall portfolio from the minimum
volatility perspective with consideration of the quality and dividend yield
perspectives.  In selecting the trust's portfolio, HIMCO also considered the
portfolio's sector exposures relative to custom sector classifications defined
by HIMCO (based on Russell Industry classifications).  The trust's sector
weightings may vary significantly from the sector weightings of the Russell
1000(R) or S&P 500 Indices.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE ISSUER OF A SECURITY MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS
   IN THE FUTURE.  This may reduce the level of dividends the trust receives
   which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the primary offering period of the
   trust.


50     Investment Summary


*  THE TRUST INVESTS IN SECURITIES SELECTED BY HIMCO.  In the event that HIMCO
   incorrectly assesses an issuer's prospects for growth or if HIMCO's
   judgment about how other investors will value an issuer's growth is wrong,
   then the price of an issuer's stock may decrease or not increase to the
   level anticipated.

*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
   circumstances, the trust will generally hold, and continue to buy, shares
   of the same securities even if their market value declines.
  

                              PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT
  
  HIMCO, Hartford Investment Management Company, is a registered investment
adviser.
  
  HIMCO is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  HIMCO selected a list of
securities to be included in the portfolio based on the criteria provided by the
sponsor.  HIMCO makes no representations that the portfolio will achieve the
investment objectives or will be profitable or suitable for any particular
potential investor.  The sponsor did not select the securities for the trust.
  
  HIMCO may use the list of securities in its independent capacity as an
investment adviser and distribute this information to various individuals and
entities.  HIMCO may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect transactions
in the securities held by the trust.  This may have an adverse effect on the
prices of the securities.  This also may have an impact on the price the trust
pays for the securities and the price received upon unit redemptions or
liquidation of the securities.  HIMCO may also issue reports and make
recommendations on securities, which may include the securities in the trust.
  
  Neither HIMCO nor the sponsor manages the trust.  Opinions expressed by HIMCO
are not necessarily those of the sponsor, and may not actually prove correct.
The trust will pay HIMCO a fee for selecting the trust's portfolio.  The trust
will also pay a license fee for the use of certain service marks, trademarks,
trade names and/or other property of HIMCO.

                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:

  *  the potential for dividend income and lower volatility compared to the
     broader U.S. equity market with capital appreciation as a secondary
     objective.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in stocks.
  
  *  seek capital preservation or capital appreciation as a primary objective.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on
November 20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit
and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less
than or equal to $10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public
offering price per unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial
sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $268
          3 years             $824
          5 years           $1,405
          10 years          $2,977
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

 STRATEGIC FOUNDATIONS OF GROWTH PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the
trust will achieve this objective.
                                        
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to provide capital appreciation by investing in a diversified
portfolio of common stocks of companies involved in aspects of agriculture,
energy, health care, precious metals, potable water, the development and
maintenance of infrastructure systems, or other related areas that could benefit
from the expanding economies of the 21st century.  Eugene E. Peroni, Jr. of
Peroni Portfolio Advisors, Inc. (the "Portfolio Consultant") selects the trust's
portfolio through the application of his proprietary method of technical
analysis, the Peroni Method(R), with consideration of investment opportunities.
  
  The Peroni Method(R) is a bottom-up approach to stock selection that is
primarily based on technical analysis.  The methodology examines a stock's price
architecture, accumulation and distribution trends and relative strength
patterns, among other more subtle trading characteristics.  This information is
partly gathered and analyzed through hand drawn point and figure charts which
have been a part of the methodology for over half a century.  While the Peroni
Method(R) is primarily focused on the technical characteristics of individual
stocks, economic, monetary, geopolitical and sentiment factors at play in the
market place are also incorporated to identify leading stocks and sectors.
  
  Technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis, which generally
involves financial scrutiny of the issuing company and considers such factors as
earnings projections, P/E ratios, cash flow and other balance sheet data.  The
Peroni Method(R) may be an investment alternative to fundamental analysis.
  
  Mr. Peroni uses the Peroni Method(R) to select stocks that he believes are
best able to provide capital appreciation.  He believes that technical factors
can help identify industry sector relative strength patterns that may play an
important role in investment success.  The methodology allows an unconstrained
approach to stock selection, spanning all market caps and investment styles,
i.e. growth and value.
  
  Eugene E. Peroni Jr. has regularly published his insights in reports offering
stock market forecasts and specific stock recommendations for both short and
longer-term investments.  Mr. Peroni regularly appears on CNBC, CBS MarketWatch,
Nightly Business Report, Fox Business News  and Bloomberg Radio, and has been
quoted in publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, U.S.
News and World Report and Investors Business Daily.
  
  Mr. Peroni began training in the field of technical research at age 16 with
his father, Eugene E. Peroni, Sr., who founded the Peroni Method(R) more than 50
years ago.  Mr. Peroni has over 40 years of experience in his field.  The Peroni
Method(R) uses a bottom-up approach, primarily emphasizing the technical merits
of individual stocks.
  
  Mr. Peroni has a library of approximately 1,000 hand-charted stocks that is
the result of extensive technical research and is regularly refreshed to include
new opportunities gleaned through ticker tape analysis, news outlets, corporate
developments and practical observations.  Charts with attractive price
architecture are noted and stocks are ranked and screened on a regular basis.
Historical characteristics are analyzed for price and volume shifts and
evaluations are made using money flow and relative strength trends.  Sector
relative strength is then determined by unbiased groupings of attractive stocks.
Portfolio construction progresses as weightings are determined by analyzing
individual stock price behavior, economic factors, monetary trends,
psychological oscillators and investor psychology.  Those stocks with the best
technical characteristics in strong or emerging leadership sectors are
candidates for inclusion in the portfolio while also taking into consideration
appropriate diversification.
  
  The Peroni Method(R) examines numerous technical, psychological and
fundamental data.  The data may include:
  
  *  a stock's historical price architecture
  
  *  net money flow trends in individual stocks


56     Investment Summary


  *  the relative behavior of a stock's price performance compared to other
     stocks in the same sector
  
  *  sentiment readings such as the volatility index
  
  *  fiscal and monetary factors
  
  *  geopolitical events and their impact on specific sectors
  
  Mr. Peroni selects stocks he believes are best suited to the trust's
investment objective, which is capital appreciation.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  THE PERONI METHOD(R) MAY NOT IDENTIFY STOCKS THAT WILL SATISFY THE TRUST'S
   INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.

*  THE TRUST IS CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES IN THE
   INDUSTRIALS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTORS.  Negative developments
   impacting companies in these sectors will affect the value of your
   investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.

*  THE TRUST MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  These
   securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than
   securities of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have
   limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less
   publicly available information.

*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
   circumstances, the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same
   securities even if their market value declines.

                              PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT
  
  The Portfolio Consultant, Peroni Portfolio Advisors, Inc., is an investment
adviser registered in Pennsylvania.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  The Portfolio
Consultant makes no representations that the portfolio will achieve the
investment objectives or will be profitable or suitable for any particular
potential investor.  The sponsor did not select the securities for the trust.
  
  The Portfolio Consultant and/or its affiliates may use the list of securities
in its independent capacity as an investment adviser and distribute this
information to various individuals and entities.  The Portfolio Consultant
and/or its affiliates may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect
transactions in the securities held by the trust.  This may have an adverse
effect on the prices of the securities.  This also may have an impact on the
price the trust pays for the securities and the price received upon unit
redemptions or liquidation of the securities.  The Portfolio Consultant and/or
its affiliates also may issue reports and makes recommendations on securities,
which may include the securities in the trust.
  
  Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor the sponsor manages the trust.  Opinions
expressed by the Portfolio Consultant are not necessarily those of the sponsor,
and may not actually come to pass.  The trust will pay the Portfolio Consultant
a fee for selecting the trust's portfolio.  The trust will also pay a license
fee for the use of certain service marks, trademarks, trade names and/or other
property of the Portfolio Consultant.

  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in common
     stocks selected based on technical analysis (rather than fundamental

  *  seek current income or capital preservation.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning November
20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit and is
paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be approximately
three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less than or equal to
$10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public offering price per
unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $269
          3 years             $826
          5 years           $1,408
          10 years          $2,985
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

     on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In accordance
     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $189,800 and $0,
     respectively.

(3)  This is a security issued by a foreign company.

     Common stocks comprise 100.00% of the investments in the trust, broken down
     by country of organization as set forth below:

 STRATEGIC HIGH 80 DIVIDEND PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return.  There is no assurance
the trust will achieve its objective.
  
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust invests in a diversified portfolio of 80 equity securities with 50
securities selected using the High 50(R) Dividend Strategy and 30 securities
selected using the International High 30 Dividend Strategy as of August 13,
2018.  Both the High 50(R) Dividend Strategy and the International High 30
Dividend Strategy are specialized dividend-oriented strategies that seek to
provide above average total return.  Each strategy is described in detail below.
We<F1>* selected the portfolio in an effort to provide an enhanced total return
while reducing overall portfolio volatility through diversification of
securities and investment strategies.
  
  The trust invests in each security in approximately equal weightings as of
the trust's inception and the weightings will vary thereafter in accordance with
fluctuations in stock prices.  We currently offer separate unit investment
trusts that invest according to the same or similar investment strategies.  The
components, portfolio securities and structure of the trust offered in this
prospectus may differ in certain respects from those other trusts we may be
offering that use similar investment strategies.
 
  HIGH 50(R) DIVIDEND STRATEGY.  This strategy selects 50 securities using a
specialized dividend-oriented strategy that seeks to provide above average total
return.  We selected the 50 securities using the following strategy:
  
  *  We begin with the companies included in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
     Composite Index, Nasdaq Composite Index and NYSE MKT Composite Index.
  
  *  Stocks are eliminated if at the time of selection:
  
     *  the company's stock market capitalization is $1 billion or less,
     
     *  the company's headquarters is located outside the United States,
     
     *  the stocks are securities of limited partnerships, exchange-traded
        funds, investment companies or shares of beneficial interest to the
        extent such securities are not otherwise excluded from the
        composition of the indexes.
     
  *  We select the five securities with the highest dividend yields from the
     remaining securities of companies in each of the nine Global Industry
     Classification Standard (GICS(R)) sectors other than the Financials and
     Real Estate sectors and the five securities with the highest dividend
     yields from the remaining securities of companies in the Financials and
     Real Estate GICS(R) sectors combined (for a total of 50 securities).
     Effectively, after September 1, 2016 the strategy seeks to treat the
     Real Estate GICS(R) sector as if it was still positioned under the
     Financials GICS(R) sector (as it was prior to September 1, 2016).  The
     trust invests in these 50 stocks.
  
  The eleven industry sectors used in the strategy are the GICS(R) sectors
published by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc.  Please note that we applied
the strategy to select the portfolio at a particular time.  If we create
additional units of the trust after the trust's inception date, the trust will
purchase the securities originally selected by applying the strategy.  This is
true even if a later application of the strategy would have resulted in the
selection of different securities.  In addition, companies which, based on
publicly available information as of two business days prior to the date of this
prospectus, are the target of an announced business acquisition which we expect
will happen, within six months of the date of this prospectus have been excluded
from the universe of securities from which the trust's securities are selected.
  
  The High 50(R) Dividend Strategy begins with the NYSE Composite Index, the
Nasdaq Composite Index and the NYSE MKT Composite Index.  The NYSE Composite
Index is designed to measure the

performance of all common stocks listed on the NYSE, including American
Depository Receipts (ADRs), real estate investment trusts (REITs) and tracking
stocks.  All closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, limited partnerships and
derivatives are excluded from the index.  The Nasdaq Composite Index measures
all domestic and international based common type stocks traded on The Nasdaq
Stock Market.  To be eligible for inclusion in this index the security's U.S.
listing must be exclusively on The Nasdaq Stock Market (with certain
exceptions), and have a security type of ADRs, common stock, limited partnership
interests, ordinary shares, REITs, shares of beneficial interest or tracking
stocks.  Security types not included in this index are closed-end funds,
convertible debentures, exchange-traded funds, preferred stocks, rights,
warrants, units and other derivative securities.  The NYSE MKT Composite Index
is an index representing the aggregate value of the common shares or ADRs of all
NYSE MKT-listed companies, REITs, master limited partnerships and closed-end
investment companies.  The publishers of the indexes are not affiliated with us
and have not participated in creating the trust or selecting the securities for
the trust, nor have they reviewed or approved of any of the information
contained herein.
  
  INTERNATIONAL HIGH 30 DIVIDEND STRATEGY.  This strategy selects 30 securities
of foreign companies selected using a specialized dividend-oriented strategy
that seeks to provide above average total return.  This strategy also seeks to
outperform the S&P ADR Index.  We selected these 30 securities using the
following strategy:
  
  *  We begin with the companies listed in the S&P ADR Index.  The S&P ADR
     Index is based on the non-U.S. stocks comprising the S&P Global 1200 Index.
     The S&P ADR Index is made up of those companies from the S&P Global 1200
     Index that offer either Level II or Level III ADRs, global shares, or
     ordinary shares in the case of Canadian equities.  The S&P Global 1200
     Index covers 30 countries and consists of seven regional components.
  
  *  From the S&P ADR Index, we select the three securities with the highest
     dividend yields in each of the nine GICS(R) sectors other than the
     Financials and Real Estate sectors and the three securities with the
     highest dividend yields in the Financials and Real Estate GICS(R) sectors
     combined.  Effectively, after September 1, 2016 the strategy seeks to treat
     the Real Estate GICS(R) sector as if it was still positioned under the
     Financials GICS(R) sector (as it was prior to September 1, 2016).
  
   *  We select those 30 stocks for the trust's portfolio.
  
  The eleven industry sectors used in the strategy are the GICS(R) sectors
published by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc.  Please note that we applied
the strategy to select the portfolio at a particular time.  If we create
additional units of the trust after the trust's inception date, the trust will
purchase the securities originally selected by applying the strategy.  This is
true even if a later application of the strategy would have resulted in the
selection of different securities.  Effective October 1, 2018 revisions are
being made to the GICS(R) structure including the renaming of the
Telecommunication Services Sector to the Communication Services Sector and the
broadening of that sector to incorporate a number of companies currently
categorized as Consumer Discretionary Sector companies.  Since the portfolio
will not be changed in connection with this change to the GICS(R) structure, it
will impact the portfolio's sector weightings.  In addition, companies which,
based on publicly available information as of two business days prior to the
date of this prospectus, are the target of an announced business combination
which we expect will happen within six months of the date of this prospectus
have been excluded from the universe of securities from which the trust's
securities are selected.
  
  The International High 30 Dividend Strategy is based on the S&P ADR Index.
The S&P ADR Index is designed to track the S&P 700 Index.  The S&P ADR Index
only includes securities that can be traded and settled in the U.S.  The index
is made up of those



62     Investment Summary


companies from the S&P 700 Index that offer either Level II or Level III ADRs,
global shares, or ordinary shares in the case of Canadian equities.  The S&P 700
Index is a subset of the S&P Global 1200 Index, representing the non-US segment
of global equity markets.  It is the S&P Global 1200 Index excluding the S&P 500
Index stocks.  The S&P Global 1200 Index is a composite index, comprised of
seven regional and country headline indices, many of which are the accepted
leaders in their local markets.  The S&P Global 1200 Index covers 30 countries
and consists of seven regional components.  The strategy is derived from stocks
contained in the S&P ADR Index.  S&P Dow Jones, a division of the S&P Global
Inc., publisher of the S&P ADR Index, is not affiliated with us and has not
participated in creating the trust or selecting the securities for the trust,
nor have they reviewed or approved of any of the information contained herein.
  
  Please note that we applied the strategy to select the portfolio at a
particular time.  If we create additional units of the trust after the trust's
inception date, the trust will purchase the securities originally selected by
applying the strategy.  This is true even if a later application of the strategy
would have resulted in the selection of different securities.  In addition,
companies which, based on publicly available information as of two business days
prior to the date of this prospectus, are the target of an announced business
acquisition which we expect will happen within six months of the date of this
prospectus have been excluded from the universe of securities from which the
trust's securities are selected.
 
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
 As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR
   MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
   in the value of your units.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.

*  THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT SUFFICIENTLY CORRESPOND TO PUBLISHED
   HYPOTHETICAL BACK-TESTED PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST'S STRATEGY.  This can
   happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings
   of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of the trust
   offering or timing of your investment, and trust expenses.  Hypothetical
   back-tested performance is not actual past performance of this or any
   trust.  Hypothetical back-tested performance is based on application of a
   trust's investment strategy as of a particular time.

*  THE TRUST MAY INVEST IN SECURITIES OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  These
   securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than
   securities of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have
   limited products or financial resources, management inexperience and less
   publicly available information.

*  SECURITIES OF FOREIGN COMPANIES HELD BY THE TRUST PRESENT RISKS BEYOND THOSE
   OF U.S. ISSUERS.  These risks may include market and political factors
   related to the company's foreign market, international trade conditions,
   less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility,
   differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign
   currencies.

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,
   the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same securities
   even if their market value declines.



                                                       Investment Summary     63


                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:
  
  *  to own a defined portfolio of securities selected based on two dividend-
     oriented investment strategies.
  
  *  to pursue a long-term investment strategy that includes investment in
     subsequent portfolios, if available.
  
  *  the potential to receive above average total return.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in the
     securities held by the trust.
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the trust's strategies.
  
  *  seek aggressive growth without current income.
  
  *  seek capital preservation.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on
November 20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit
and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be
approximately three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less
than or equal to $10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public
offering price per unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial
sales fee.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:

                HYPOTHETICAL BACK-TESTED PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
  
  The following table compares hypothetical back-tested performance information
for the strategy employed by the trust, the High 50(R) Dividend Strategy, the
International High 30 Dividend Strategy, and the actual performance of the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index in each of the years listed (and as of the most
recent month end).  These hypothetical returns do not guarantee and should not
be used to predict future performance of the trust.  Returns from the trust will
differ from the hypothetical back-tested strategy returns for several reasons,
including:
  
  *  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on
     the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur;
  
  *  strategy returns are for calendar years (and through the most recent
     month), while trusts begin and end on various dates;

  *  extraordinary market events that we have not expected to be repeated and
     may have affected performance;
  
  *  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year;
  
  *  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in
     all securities comprising its strategy; and
  
  *  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the
     closing prices used in buying and selling units.
  
  You should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any
index, and it is not expected that it will do so.  In fact, the trust's strategy
underperformed its comparative indexes in certain years and we cannot guarantee
that the trust will outperform any index over the life of the trust or over
consecutive rollover periods, if available.

                                                       Investment Summary     69


  Hypothetical back-tested performance is no guarantee of future results.
Hypothetical back-tested performance of the trust strategy (the Strategic High
80 Dividend Strategy), High 50(R) Dividend Strategy and International High 30
Dividend Strategy securities (the "strategy securities") is hypothetical (and
does not represent any actual trust), is shown for illustrative purposes only
and is not intended to indicate the future performance of any investment,
including the trust.  The strategy securities for a given year consist of the
securities selected by applying the strategy as of the beginning of the period
(and not the date the trust actually sells units).  The hypothetical back-tested
past performance of the Strategic High 80 Dividend Strategy securities for 1 of
the 11 periods shown are the result of extraordinary market events and are not
expected to be repeated.
  
  Securities are selected through application of a strategy at a particular
point in time and if a security which is a component of a strategy is merged out
of existence, de-listed or suffers a similar fate during the period in which the
strategy performance is being measured, such security will not be replaced by
another security during that period. The strategy is not rebalanced during each
one year period and as a result the stocks used for determining hypothetical
back-tested performance will not take into account subsequent changes to the
indexes used as a starting point for the strategy.
  
  Prior to the market close on August 31, 2016, there were ten GICS(R) sectors
and after the market close on August 31, 2016, a Real Estate GICS(R) sector was
added, elevating its position from under the Financials GICS(R) sector, bringing
the total number of GICS(R) sectors to eleven.  Prior to August 31, 2016, the
Strategic High 80 Strategy selected eight securities from (after the application
of certain screens) each of the then existing ten GICS(R) sectors.  After August
31, 2016, the Strategic High 80 Strategy selects eight securities from each of
the nine GICS(R) sectors other than the Financials and Real Estate sectors and
eight additional securities from the Financials and Real Estate GICS(R) sectors
combined (for a total of 80 securities) after the application of certain
screens.  The hypothetical back-tested performance for 2016 and earlier are
based on the Strategic High 80 Strategy with ten GICS(R) sectors.
  
  Total return represents the sum of the change in market value of each group
of securities between the first and last trading day of a period plus the total
dividends paid on each group of securities during such period divided by the
opening market value of each group of securities as of the first trading day of
a period.  Total return shown in the table above figures assume that all
dividends are reinvested semi-annually.  Strategy figures reflect the deduction
of sales charges and expenses but have not been reduced by estimated brokerage
commissions and other transaction costs paid by the trust in acquiring
securities or any taxes incurred by investors.
  
  Hypothetical back-tested returns are hypothetical, meaning that they do not
represent actual trading, and, thus, may not reflect material economic and
market factors, such as liquidity constraints, that may have had an impact on
actual decision making. The hypothetical performance is the retroactive
application of the strategy designed with the full benefit of hindsight.
  
  The S&P 500 Index is an index that includes a representative sample of 500
leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy.  Although the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index focuses on the large-cap segment of the market, with
over 80% coverage of U.S. equities, it is also often considered a proxy for the
total U.S. stock market.
  
  The indexes are unmanaged, not subject to fees, and not available for direct
investment.
  
  The publisher of the index is not affiliated with us and has not participated
in creating the trust or selecting the securities for the trust, nor has the

 TACTICAL PLUS CLOSED-END PORTFOLIO - 15 MONTH
------------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
 The trust seeks to provide high current income with capital appreciation as a
secondary objective.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its
objective.
                                        
                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
 The trust seeks to provide high current income with capital appreciation
potential by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of common stock of
closed-end investment companies (known as "closed-end funds").  The underlying
funds may invest in a variety of income-producing securities issued by various
types of foreign and/or U.S. issuers.  Among other securities, these securities
may include corporate bonds, government bonds, corporate loans, convertible
securities, preferred securities and equity securities.  These securities may be
rated investment grade, below investment grade or unrated by major security
rating agencies.
  
 In selecting these closed-end funds, we<F1>* considered factors such as
historical returns, income potential, potential future growth, portfolio
diversification and advisor experience.  We use a disciplined investment
methodology to select the funds for inclusion in the trust.  We begin by
constructing a universe of funds that have a stated investment objective in line
with the trust's investment objective and that the fund advisor appears to be
adhering to.  From this universe we select the final securities by utilizing a
multi-factor approach based on the following factors:
  
*  Dividend--The primary factor is an above average dividend and we favor funds
   that have a history of a consistent and competitive dividend and that
   appear to possess the ability to keep the dividend level intact.

*  Premium/Discount--We also favor funds that are trading at a discount relative
   to their peers and relative to their historic average.

*  Performance--We also favor funds that have an above average history of
   performance based on net asset value when compared to their peers and a
   relevant benchmark.

 Approximately 40.03% of the portfolio consists of funds classified as "non-
diversified" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  These funds have the
ability to invest more than 5% of their assets in securities of a single issuer
which could reduce diversification.  Under normal circumstances, the trust will
invest at least 80% of its assets in closed-end investment companies.
 
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
 As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES IN THE CLOSED-END FUNDS WILL GENERALLY FALL IF
   INTEREST RATES, IN GENERAL, RISE.  No one can predict whether interest
   rates will rise or fall in the future.

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE INCOME AND/OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN THE
   FUTURE.  This may reduce the level of dividends a closed-end fund pays
   which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.

*  THE TRUST INVESTS IN SHARES OF CLOSED-END FUNDS.  You should understand the
   section titled "Closed-End Funds" before you invest.  In particular, shares
   of these funds tend to trade at a discount from their net asset value and
   are subject to risks related to factors such as the manager's ability to
   achieve a fund's objective, market conditions affecting a fund's
   investments and use of leverage.  The trust and the underlying funds have
   management and operating expenses.  You will bear not only your share of
   the trust's expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds.  By
   investing in other funds, the trust incurs greater expenses than you would
   incur if you invested directly in the funds.

*  SECURITIES OF FOREIGN ISSUERS HELD BY THE UNDERLYING FUNDS IN THE TRUST
   PRESENT RISKS BEYOND THOSE OF U.S. ISSUERS.  These risks may include market
   and political factors related to the issuer's foreign market, international
   trade conditions, the global and country-specific political environment,
   less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility,
   differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign
   currencies.

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  While the closed-end funds have
   managed portfolios, except in limited circumstances, the trust will hold,
   and continue to buy, shares of the same funds even if their market value
   declines.

                                WHO SHOULD INVEST
  
  You should consider this investment if you want:
  
  *  to own securities representing interests in managed funds that pursue
     income-oriented investment strategies.
  
  *  to diversify your overall portfolio with investments in various types of
     securities.
  
  *  to pursue a long-term investment strategy that includes investment in
     subsequent portfolios, if available.
  
  *  the potential to receive monthly distributions of income.
  
  You should not consider this investment if you:
  
  *  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in closed-end
     funds that pursue income-oriented investment strategies.
  
  *  seek capital preservation or capital appreciation as a primary objective.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning November
20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit and is
paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be approximately
three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less than or equal to
$10, you will not pay an initial sales fee.  When the public offering price per
unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial sales fee.  The trust
will indirectly bear the management and operating expenses of the underlying
closed-end funds.  While the trust will not pay these expenses directly out of
its assets, these expenses are shown in the trust's annual operating expenses
above to illustrate the impact of these expenses.

                                     EXAMPLE

  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $452
          3 years           $1,363
          5 years           $2,283
          10 years          $4,623
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase such securities.  The
     value of each security is based on the most recent closing sale price of
     each security as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock
     Exchange on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In
     accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value
     Measurements", the trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which
     refers to security prices determined using quoted prices in active markets
     for identical securities.

 UBIQUITOUS STRATEGY PORTFOLIO - 15 MONTH
---------------------------------------------


                              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
  
  The trust seeks to provide above average total return primarily through
capital appreciation.  There is no assurance the trust will achieve its
objective.
  

                          PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
  
  The trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of
stocks of companies deriving a substantial portion of their revenues worldwide
that Pence Capital Management, LLC (the "Portfolio Consultant") believes are
involved in aspects of the transformation of consumer behavior and a shift in
how people transact purchases.  Today, shopping has become easier as innovations
in electronics and information technology provide consumers access to a wide
range of products from the convenience of almost anywhere and the ease of using
their smart phones and tablets.  Consumers can fulfill desires spontaneously
without going to brick and mortar stores.  Consumers shop online using smart
phones and tablets, connect wirelessly from almost anywhere, are able to
purchase almost any product online, pay by credit cards and have products
delivered to their doorsteps.
  
  From these companies involved in aspects of this shift in how people transact
purchases, securities were selected for the trust's portfolio by analyzing
factors including expected market dominance over the next three to five years,
relative size within industry sectors based on market capitalization, steadiness
of past earnings growth rates and revenue growth, strength of earnings and
revenue projects, balance sheet strength, valuation and levels of cash holdings.
  
                                 PRINCIPAL RISKS
  
  As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:

*  SECURITY PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over
   time.

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
   DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
   at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.

*  THE ISSUER OF A SECURITY MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS
   IN THE FUTURE.  This may reduce the level of dividends the trust receives
   which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall.

*  THE TRUST IS CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES IN THE
   INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.  Negative developments in the information
   technology sector will affect the value of your investment more than would
   be the case in a more diversified investment.

*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
   circumstances, the trust will generally hold, and continue to buy, shares
   of the same securities even if their market value declines.

  The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 1.85% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning November
20, 2018.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05 per unit and is
paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be approximately
three months).  When the public offering price per unit is less than or equal to
$10, you will not pay an initial sales fee. When the public offering price per
unit is greater than $10 per unit, you will pay an initial sales fee.
                                        
                                     EXAMPLE
                                        
  This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:
  
          1 year              $261
          3 years             $802
          5 years           $1,369
          10 years          $2,909
  
  This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust
each year subject to a sales charge of 1.85%.

Notes to Portfolio

(1)  Securities are represented by contracts to purchase securities.  The value
     of each security is based on the most recent closing sale price of each
     security as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
     on the business day prior to the trust's inception date.  In accordance
     with Accounting Standards Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the
     trust's investments are classified as Level 1, which refers to security
     prices determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities.

(2)  The cost of the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or
     (loss) (which is the difference between the cost of the securities to the
     sponsor and the cost of the securities to the trust) are $190,078 and $0,
     respectively.

(3)  This is a non-income producing security.

---------------------------------------------
 UNDERSTANDING YOUR INVESTMENT
---------------------------------------------

  

                                HOW TO BUY UNITS
  
  You can buy units of a trust on any business day the New York Stock Exchange
is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are available
daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMLIVE.COM.  The public offering price of units
includes:
  
  *  the net asset value per unit plus
  
  *  organization costs plus
  
  *  the sales fee.
  
  The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in your trust reduced by the liabilities of your trust divided by the
total units or your trust outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering
price of units as the price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be
effective for all orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your
order prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or
authorized financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and
properly transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will
receive the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order
after the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized
financial professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are
received by such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we
designate, then you will receive the price computed on the date of the next
determined offer price provided that your order is received in a timely manner
on that date.  It is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional
to transmit the orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain
broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit
purchase orders.
  
  VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities using the last
sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange.  For this
purpose, the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service
approved by us.  In some cases we will price a security based on its fair value
after considering appropriate factors relevant to the value of the security.  We
will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national
securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.
  
  We determined the initial prices of the securities shown under each
"Portfolio" section in this prospectus as described above at the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day before the
date of this prospectus.  On the first day we sell units we will compute the
unit price as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or
the time the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission becomes effective, if later.
  
  ORGANIZATION COSTS.  During the initial offering period, part of the value of
the units represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your trust.
These costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal
documents, a portfolio consultant's security selection fee (if any), federal and
state registration fees, the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the
initial audit.  Your trust will sell securities to reimburse us for these costs
at the end of the initial offering period or after six months, if earlier.


78     Understanding Your Investment


The value of your units will decline when your trust pays these costs.
  
  SALES FEE.  The maximum sales fee is shown under "Fees and Expenses" for your
trust and is 1.85% of the public offering price per unit at the time of
purchase.
  
  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.  We refer to this fee as
the "transactional sales fee".  The transactional sales fee has both an initial
and a deferred component.  The transactional sales fee equals 1.35% of the
public offering price per unit based on a $10 public offering price per unit.
The percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price
on your trust's inception date.  The transactional sales fee equals the
difference between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee.  As
a result, the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will
vary as the public offering price per unit varies.  The transactional sales fee
does not include the creation and development fee which is described under "Fees
and Expenses" for your trust.
  
  You pay the initial sales fee, if any, at the time you buy units.  The
initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage
(maximum of 1.85% of the public offering price per unit) and the sum of the
remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation
and development fee.  The initial sales fee will be 0.00% of the public offering
price per unit at a public offering price per unit of $10.  If the public
offering price per unit exceeds $10, you will be charged an initial sales fee
equal to the difference between the total sales fee percentage (maximum of 1.85%
of the public offering price per unit) and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar
deferred sales fee and total fixed dollar creation and development fee.  The
deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.135 per unit.  Your trust pays the deferred
sales fee in equal monthly installments as described under "Fees and Expenses"
for your trust.  If you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the
total deferred sales fee, you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon
redemption or sale of your units.
  
  Since the deferred sales fee and creation and development fee are fixed
dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these amounts per unit
regardless of any decrease in net asset value.  As a result, if the public
offering price per unit falls to less than $10 (resulting in the maximum sales
fee percentage being a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar
amounts of the deferred sales fee and creation and development fee) your initial
sales fee will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar fees
exceed the sales fee at the time you buy units.  In such a situation, the value
of securities per unit would exceed the public offering price per unit by the
amount of the initial sales fee credit and the value of those securities will
fluctuate, which could result in a benefit or detriment to unitholders that
purchase units at that price.  The initial sales fee credit is paid by the
sponsor and is not paid by the trust.
  
  If you purchase units after the last deferred sales fee payment has been
assessed, the secondary market sales fee is equal to 1.85% of the public
offering price and does not include deferred payments (i.e. unitholders who buy
in the secondary market after collection of the deferred sales fees are not
charged deferred sales fees).
  
  MINIMUM PURCHASE.  The minimum amount you can purchase appears under
"Essential Information" for your trust, but such amounts may vary depending on
your selling firm.


                                            Understanding Your Investment     79


  REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of
any discount when you order units.  Except as expressly provided herein, you may
not combine discounts.  Since the deferred sales fee and the creation and
development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these
fees per unit regardless of any discounts.  However, if you are eligible to
receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the fixed dollar
amounts of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee, we will
credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these fixed dollar
fees at the time you buy units.
  
  Fee Accounts.  Investors may purchase units through registered investment
advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each
case either charge investor accounts ("Fee Accounts") periodic fees for
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management
services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed.  You should
consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these
accounts.  To purchase units in these Fee Accounts, your financial advisor must
purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if
available.  Please contact your financial advisor for more information.  If
units are purchased for a Fee Account and the units are subject to a Wrap Fee in
such Fee Account (i.e., the trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible") then investors may be
eligible to purchase units in these Fee Accounts that are not subject to the
transactional sales fee but will be subject to the creation and development fee
that is retained by the sponsor.  For example, this table illustrates the sales
fee you will pay as a percentage of the initial $10 public offering price per
unit (the percentage will vary with the unit price).
  
  Initial sales fee                0.00%
  Deferred sales fee               0.00%

    Transactional sales fee        0.00%

  Creation and development fee     0.50%

    Total sales fee                0.50%
                                  =======
  
  This discount applies only during the initial offering period.  Certain Fee
Account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees on the purchase
and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other processing
organizations for providing certain transaction or account activities.  We
reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in Fee Accounts by
investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be
detrimental to a trust.
  
  Employees.  We waive the transactional sales fee for purchases made by
officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of the sponsor
and its affiliates.  These purchases are not subject to the transactional sales
fee but will be subject to the creation and development fee.  We also waive a
portion of the sales fee for purchases made by officers, directors and employees
(and immediate family members) of selling firms.  These purchases are made at
the public offering price per unit less the applicable regular dealer
concession.  Immediate family members for the purposes of this section include
your spouse, children (including step-children) under the age of 21 living in
the same household, and parents (including step-parents).  These discounts apply
to initial offering period and secondary market purchases.  All employee
discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm, including but
not limited to, householding policies or limitations.  Only officers, directors
and employees (and their immediate family members) of selling firms that


80     Understanding Your Investment


allow such persons to participate in this employee discount program are eligible
for the discount.
  
  Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  We do not charge any sales fee when you reinvest
distributions from your trust into additional units of your trust.  This sales
fee discount applies to initial offering period and secondary market purchases.
Since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are fixed
dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these fees per unit regardless
of this discount.  If you elect the distribution reinvestment plan, we will
credit you with additional units with a dollar value sufficient to cover the
amount of any remaining deferred sales fee or creation and development fee that
will be collected on such units at the time of reinvestment.  The dollar value
of these units will fluctuate over time.
  
  RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  Your portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.
  
                             HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS
  
  You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMLIVE.COM or through your financial
professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the net asset
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and
development fee or organization costs if you sell or redeem units during the
initial offering period.  The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to
as the "liquidation price."  You pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you
sell or redeem your units.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or
other fee for processing unit redemption or sale requests.
  
  SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset
value, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and development fee
or organization costs if you sell units during the initial offering period.  We
may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or
redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase price is
the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a
secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial professional for
current repurchase prices to determine the best price available.  We may
discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice.  Even if we do not
make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any
business day for the current redemption price.
  
  REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee,
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and
development fee or organization costs if you redeem units during the initial
offering period.  You will pay any remaining deferred sales fee at the time you
redeem units.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if the
trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based


                                            Understanding Your Investment     81


on the date of receipt.  Redemption requests received by the trustee after the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, redemption requests
received by authorized financial professionals after that time or redemption
requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the trustee until
after the time designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of the
next determined redemption price provided they are received in a timely manner
by the trustee on such date.  It is the responsibility of authorized financial
professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the trustee so
they will be received in a timely manner.  If your request is not received in a
timely manner or is incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset
value computed after the trustee receives your completed request.
  
  If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary
documentation (this will usually only take two business days).  The only time
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.
  
  You can request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying your
units if you tender at least 2,500 units for redemption (or such other amount as
required by your financial professional's firm).  This option is generally
available only for securities traded and held in the United States.  The trustee
will make any in-kind distribution of securities by distributing applicable
securities in book entry form to the account of your financial professional at
Depository Trust Company.  You will receive whole shares of the applicable
securities and cash equal to any fractional shares.  You may not request this
option in the last 30 days of your trust's life.  We may discontinue this option
upon sixty days notice.
  
  ROLLOVER OPTION.  Your trust's strategy may be a long-term investment
strategy designed to be followed on an annual basis.  You may achieve more
consistent long-term investment results by following the strategy.  As part of
the strategy, we currently intend to offer a subsequent series of your trust for
a rollover when the current trust terminates.  When your trust terminates you
will have the option to (1) participate in a rollover and have your units
reinvested into a subsequent trust series through a cash rollover as described
in this section, (2) receive an in-kind distribution of securities or (3)
receive a cash distribution.
  
  If you elect to participate in a rollover, your units will be redeemed on
your trust's termination date.  As the redemption proceeds become available, the
proceeds (including dividends) will be invested in a new trust series, if
available, at the public offering price for the new trust.  The trustee will
attempt to sell securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable
on the termination date.  We do not anticipate that the sale period will be
longer than one day, however, certain factors could affect the ability to sell
the securities and could impact the length of the sale period.  The liquidity of
any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount
available for redemption and reinvestment on any day.
  
  We intend to make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times
during the year.  Of course, we cannot guarantee that a subsequent


82     Understanding Your Investment


trust or sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will
offer the same investment strategies or objectives as current trusts.  We cannot
guarantee that a rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences
resulting from trading large volumes of securities.  Market price trends may
make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than
permitted by the trust procedures.  We may, in our sole discretion, modify a
rollover or stop creating units of any future trust at any time regardless of
whether all proceeds of unitholders have been reinvested in a rollover.  We may
decide not to offer a rollover option upon sixty days notice.  Cash which has
not been reinvested in a rollover will be distributed to unitholders shortly
after the termination date.  Rollover participants may receive taxable dividends
or realize taxable capital gains which are reinvested in connection with a
rollover but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the
"wash sale" tax rules.  Due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust, no cash
will be distributed to pay any taxes.  See "Understanding Your Investment--
Taxes".
  
                                  DISTRIBUTIONS
  
  DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment
income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of
record on the preceding record date.  If your trust is a "grantor trust" for
federal tax purposes, the trust will generally only make a distribution if the
total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of the trust's net asset
value as determined under the trust agreement.  The record and distribution
dates and the tax status are shown under "Essential Information" in the
"Investment Summary" section of this prospectus for your trust.  In some cases,
your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of
cash pending distribution.  For example, this could happen as a result of a
merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your
portfolio.  Your trust will also generally make required distributions or
distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it is
structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes.  The
amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change
their dividends and other income distributions or trust expenses change.
  
  When your trust receives dividends and other income distributions from a
portfolio security, the trustee credits such payments to the trust's accounts.
In an effort to make relatively regular income distributions, if your trust is a
"regulated investment company" for tax purposes and makes monthly distributions,
your trust's monthly income distribution is equal to one twelfth of the
estimated net annual income distributions to be received by your trust after
deduction of trust operating expenses.  Because a trust does not receive income
distributions from the portfolio securities at a constant rate throughout the
year, the income distributions to unitholders from such a trust may be more or
less than the amount credited to your trust accounts as of the record date.  For
the purpose of minimizing fluctuation in income distributions, the trustee is
authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide income
distributions of approximately equal amounts.  The trustee will be reimbursed,
without interest, for any such advances from available income received by a
trust on the ensuing record date.
  
  REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each
distribution.  Each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your
trust's activity and certain tax information.  You can


                                            Understanding Your Investment     83


request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms
and audited financial statements for your trust, if available.
  
                                INVESTMENT RISKS
  
  All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.
  
  MARKET RISK.  Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in
your trust will fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall
below your original purchase price.  Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors.  These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or
ratings on a security.  Even though we supervise your portfolio, you should
remember that we do not manage your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a
security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.
  
  SELECTION RISK.  Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected for
inclusion by your trust or by a fund's management will underperform the markets,
relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar
investment objectives and investment strategies.  This means you may lose money
or earn less money than other comparable investments.
  
  EQUITY SECURITIES.  Your trust and/or certain funds held by your trust may
invest in securities representing equity ownership of a company.  Investments in
such securities are exposed to risks associated with the companies issuing the
securities, the sectors and geographic locations they are  involved in and the
markets that such securities are traded on among other risks as described
herein.
  
  FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
fixed income securities and similar securities.  Fixed income securities involve
certain unique risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk among other
things as described in greater detail below.
  
  DIVIDEND PAYMENT RISK.  Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security.  Stocks represent
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments.  Dividends are paid only when
declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may
vary over time.
  
  STRATEGY CORRELATION RISK.  Strategy correlation risk is the risk that your
trust's performance will not sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical back-
tested performance of your trust's investment strategy, if any.  This risk
applies to your trust if the "Investment Summary" section for your trust in this
prospectus includes "Hypothetical Back-tested Performance Information."  This
can happen for reasons such as:
  
  *  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact
     weightings at a given time,
  
  *  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may
     be created at various times during the year and generally have 15 month
     terms,


84     Understanding Your Investment


  *  your trust may not be fully invested at all times, and
  
  *  trust fees and expenses.
  
  Hypothetical back-tested performance is not actual past performance of this
or any trust.  Hypothetical back-tested performance is based on application of a
trust's investment strategy as of a particular time.
  
  CREDIT RISK.  Credit risk is the risk that a borrower is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on a security held by a fund.  This
could cause the value of your units to fall and may reduce the level of
dividends a fund pays which would reduce your income.
  
  INTEREST RATE RISK.  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixed
income securities and similar securities held by a fund will fall if interest
rates increase.  Bonds and other fixed income securities typically fall in value
when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall.  Securities
with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate
changes.  The securities in your trust may be subject to a greater risk of
rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period
of historically low rates.
  
  CLOSED-END FUNDS.  Your portfolio may invest in shares of closed-end
investment companies.  Closed-end funds are subject to various risks, including
but not limited to management's ability to meet the closed-end fund's investment
objective including when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold, risks
associated with the use of leverage and borrowing and risks associated with
shares of the fund trading at a discount or premium to the fund's net asset
value.  You should understand the section titled "Understanding Your Investment-
-Closed-End Funds" before you invest.
  
  NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISK.  Certain funds held by your trust may be classified
as "non-diversified".  Such funds may be more exposed to the risks associated
with and developments affecting an individual issuer, industry and/or asset
class than a fund that invests more widely.
  
  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY RISK.  Certain funds held by your trust may
invest in business development companies ("BDCs").  BDCs are closed-end
investment companies that have elected to be treated as business development
companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  BDCs are required to hold
at least 70% of their investments in eligible assets which include, among other
things, (i) securities of eligible portfolio companies (generally, domestic
companies that are not investment companies and that cannot have a class of
securities listed on a national securities exchange or have securities that are
marginable that are purchased from that company in a private transaction), (ii)
securities received by the BDC in connection with its ownership of securities of
eligible portfolio companies, or (iii) cash, cash items, government securities,
or high quality debt securities maturing one year or less from the time of
investment.  BDCs' ability to grow and their overall financial condition is
impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital.  In addition to
raising capital through the issuance of common stock, BDCs may engage in
borrowing.  This may involve using revolving credit facilities, the
securitization of loans through separate wholly-owned subsidiaries and issuing
of debt and preferred securities.  BDCs are less restricted than other closed-
end funds as to the amount of debt they can have outstanding.  These borrowings,
also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts
invested


                                            Understanding Your Investment     85


and, accordingly, the risks associated with investing in BDC securities.  While
the value of a BDC's assets increases, leveraging would cause the net value per
share of BDC common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had such
BDC not leveraged.  However, if the value of a BDC's assets decreases,
leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise
would have had such BDC not leveraged.  In addition to decreasing the value of a
BDC's common stock, it could also adversely impact a BDC's ability to make
dividend payments.  A BDC's credit rating may change over time which could
adversely affect its ability to obtain additional credit and/or increase the
cost of such borrowing.  Agreements governing a BDC's credit facilities and
related funding and service agreements may contain various covenants that limit
the BDC's discretion in operating its business along with other limitations.
Any defaults may restrict the BDC's ability to manage assets securing related
assets, which may adversely impact the BDC's liquidity and operations.  BDCs may
enter into hedging transaction and utilize derivative instruments such as
forward contracts, options and swaps.  Unanticipated movements and improper
correlation of hedging instruments may prevent a BDC from hedging against
exposure to risk of loss.  BDCs may issue options, warrants, and rights to
convert to voting securities to its officers, employees and board members.  Any
issuance of derivative securities requires the approval of the company's board
of directors and authorization by the company's shareholders.  A BDC may operate
a profit-sharing plan for its employees, subject to certain restrictions.
  
  BDC investments are frequently not publicly traded and, as a result, there is
uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments.  BDCs may use
independent valuation firms to value their investments and such valuations may
be uncertain, be based on estimates and/or differ materially from that which
would have been used if a ready market for those investments existed.  The value
of a BDC could be adversely affected if its determinations regarding the fair
value of investments was materially higher than the value realized upon sale of
such investments.  Due to the relative illiquidity of certain BDC investments,
if a BDC is required to liquidate all or a portion of its portfolio quickly, it
may realize significantly less than the value at which such investments are
recorded.  Further restrictions may exist on the ability to liquidate certain
assets to the extent that subsidiaries or related parties have material non-
public information regarding such assets.  BDCs are required to make available
significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies.  Significant
managerial assistance refers to any arrangement whereby a BDC provides
significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or
business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.  Examples of such
activities include arranging financing, managing relationships with financing
sources, recruiting management personnel, and evaluating acquisition and
divestiture opportunities.  BDCs are frequently externally managed by an
investment adviser which may also provide this external managerial assistance to
portfolio companies.  Such investment adviser's liability may be limited under
its investment advisory agreement, which may lead such investment adviser to act
in a riskier manner than it would were it investing for its own account.  Such
investment advisers may be entitled to incentive compensation which may cause
such adviser to make more speculative and riskier investments than it would if
investing for its own account.  Such compensation may be due even in the case of
declines to the value of a BDC's investments.


86     Understanding Your Investment


  BDCs frequently have high expenses which may include, but are not limited to,
the payment of management fees, administration expenses, taxes, interest payable
on debt, governmental charges, independent director fees and expenses, valuation
expenses, and fees payable to third parties relating to or associated with
making investments.  If your trust invests in BDCs, then your trust will
indirectly bear these expenses.  These expenses may fluctuate significantly over
time.  If a BDC fails to maintain its status as a BDC it may be regulated as a
closed-end fund which would subject such BDC to additional regulatory
restrictions and significantly decrease its operating flexibility.  In addition,
such failure could trigger an event of default under certain outstanding
indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on its business.
  
  INVESTMENT IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES.  As with other investments,
investments in other investment companies are subject to market and selection
risk.  In addition, if/when your trust acquires shares of investment companies
shareholders bear both their proportionate share of fees and expenses in your
trust and, indirectly, the expenses of the underlying investment companies.
Investment companies' expenses are subject to the risk of fluctuation including
in response to fluctuation in a fund's assets.  Accordingly, a fund's actual
expenses may vary from what is indicated at the time of investment by your
trust.  There are certain regulatory limitations on the ability of your trust to
hold other investment companies which may impact the trust's ability to invest
certain funds, may impact the weighting of a fund in your trust's portfolio and
may impact your trust's ability to issue additional units in the future.
  
  INVESTMENT PROCESS RISK.  Your trust may invest in securities selected by
HIMCO.  In the event that HIMCO incorrectly assesses an issuer's prospects for
growth or if HIMCO's judgment about how other investors will value an issuer's
growth is wrong, then the price of an issuer's stock may decrease or not
increase to the level anticipated.
  
  SECTOR CONCENTRATION RISK.  Sector concentration risk is the risk that the
value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that
impact a particular sector because the exposure to such sectors through the
securities held by your trust or through the securities in the funds held by
your trust are concentrated within a particular sector.  Refer to the "Principal
Risks" in the "Investment Summary" section for your trust in this prospectus for
sector concentrations.
  
  Your trust may invest significantly in securities of CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES companies.  These companies manufacture or sell various consumer
products and/or services. General risks of these companies include the general
state of the economy, intense competition and consumer spending trends.  A
decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable
income can negatively impact spending habits.  Competitiveness in the retail
industry will require large capital outlays for the installation of automated
checkout equipment to control inventory, track the sale of items and gauge the
success of sales campaigns.  Retailers who sell their products and services over
the Internet have the potential to access more consumers, but will require
sophisticated technology to remain competitive.
  
  Your trust may invest significantly in securities of ENERGY COMPANIES.
Energy companies include, but are not limited to, companies that explore for,
produce, refine, transport, store, gather, process, distribute or sell
petroleum, gas products or consumable fuels, or provide parts or services to
petroleum, gas or consumable fuel companies.  These companies are subject to


                                            Understanding Your Investment     87


volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels and can be impacted by
international politics, including wars and hostilities, supply and demand,
depletion, rising interest rates, exploration activities, policy shifts by
governmental entities and intergovernmental entities such as OPEC, weather,
terrorist attacks, reduced demand as a result of increases in energy efficiency
and energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, clean-up and
litigation costs relating to oil spills and environmental damage, and tax and
other regulatory policies of various governments.  Natural disasters will also
impact companies in the energy industry.  Oil production and refining companies
are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and
regulations regarding air emissions and the disposal of hazardous materials.
Companies engaged in the exploration, development, management or production of
energy commodities face the risk that commodity reserves are depleted over time,
or that estimates of such reserves are overstated or will not be produced in the
time periods anticipated.
  
  Your trust may invest significantly in securities of HEALTH CARE COMPANIES.
Companies in the health care industry are subject to governmental regulation of
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or
services.  Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological
advances will render their products obsolete.  The research and development
costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy
governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come
to market.  Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain
products for several years.  Such companies may also have persistent losses
during a new product's transition from development to production, and revenue
patterns may be erratic.  In addition, healthcare facility operators may be
affected by events and conditions including, among other things, demand for
services, the ability of the facility to provide the services required,
physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition
with other hospitals, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,
government regulation, the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice
insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial
assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar
third-party payor programs.
  
  Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from
time to time.  These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of
healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare
insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans.  We are unable to
predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the issuers of
securities in your trust.
  
  Your trust may invest significantly in securities of INDUSTRIALS COMPANIES.
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess
capacity and consumer spending trends.  Capital goods companies may also be
significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles,
technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key
materials, labor


88     Understanding Your Investment


relations, government regulations, government contracts and ecommerce
initiatives.  Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny.
  
  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries.  Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.  The
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment
manufacturers.
  
  Your trust may invest significantly in securities of companies in the
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY sector. Technology companies are generally subject to the
risks of rapidly changing technologies; short product life cycles; fierce
competition; aggressive pricing; frequent introduction of new or enhanced
products; the loss of patent, copyright and trademark protections; cyclical
market patterns; evolving industry standards; and frequent new product
introductions. Technology companies may be smaller and less experienced
companies, with limited product lines, markets or financial resources.
Technology company stocks have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations
that are often unrelated to their operating performance, and have lately
experienced significant market declines in their share values. Also, the stocks
of many internet companies have exceptionally high price-to-earnings ratios with
little or no earnings histories.
  
  EUROPEAN ISSUER RISKS.  The European Select Portfolio invests in securities
issued by companies in Europe.  The trust is therefore subject to certain risks
associated specifically with Europe.  A significant number of countries in
Europe are member states in the European Union, and the member states no longer
control their own monetary policies by directing independent interest rates for
their currencies.  In these member states, the authority to direct monetary
policies including money supply and official interest rates for the Euro is
exercised by the European Central Bank.  Furthermore, the European sovereign
debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had,
and continue to have, a significant impact on the economies of certain European
countries and their future economic outlooks.
  
  FOREIGN ISSUER RISK.  Your trust and/or certain funds held by your trust may
invest in the securities of foreign issuers.  An investment in securities of
foreign issuers involves certain risks that are different in some respects from
an investment in securities of domestic issuers.  These include risks associated
with future political and economic developments, international trade conditions,
foreign withholding taxes, liquidity concerns, currency fluctuations,
volatility, restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities,
potential for expropriation of assets, confiscatory taxation, difficulty in
obtaining or enforcing a court judgment, potential inability to collect when a
company goes bankrupt and economic, political or social instability.  Moreover,
individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S.
economy for reasons including differences in growth of gross domestic product,
rates of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources, self-sufficiency and
balance of payments positions  There may be less publicly available information
about a foreign issuer than is available from a domestic issuer as a result of
different accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards.  Some foreign
markets are less liquid than U.S. markets which could cause securities to


                                            Understanding Your Investment     89


be bought at a higher price or sold at a lower price than would be the case in a
highly liquid market.
  
  Brokerage and other transaction costs on foreign exchanges are often higher
than in the U.S. and there is generally less governmental supervision of
exchanges, brokers and issuers in foreign countries.  The increased expense of
investing in foreign markets may reduce the amount an investor can earn on its
investments and typically results in a higher operating expense ratio than
investments in only domestic securities.  Custody of certain securities may be
maintained by a global custody and clearing institution.  Settlement and
clearance procedures in certain foreign markets differ significantly from those
in the U.S.  Foreign settlement and clearance procedures and trade regulations
also may involve certain risks (such as delays in payment for or delivery of
securities) not typically associated with the settlement of domestic securities.
Round lot trading requirements exist in certain foreign securities markets which
could cause the proportional composition and diversification of your trust's
and/or a fund's portfolio to vary when your trust or a fund buys or sells
securities.
  
  CURRENCY RISK.  Because securities of foreign issuers not listed on a U.S.
securities exchange generally pay income and trade in foreign currencies, the
U.S. dollar value of these securities and income will vary with fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates.  Most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value
against the U.S. dollar for various economic and political reasons.  Generally,
when the U.S. dollar rises in value against a foreign currency, a security
denominated in that currency loses value because the currency is worth fewer
U.S. dollars.  Conversely, when the U.S. dollar decreases in value against a
foreign currency, a security denominated in that currency gains value because
the currency is worth more U.S. dollars.  This risk, generally known as
"currency risk," means that a strong U.S. dollar will reduce returns for U.S.
investors while a weak U.S. dollar will increase those returns.
  
  DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS RISK.  Certain stocks held by your trust and/or the
closed-end funds may be held in the form of depositary receipts.  Depositary
receipts represent receipts for foreign common stock deposited with a custodian
(which may include the trustee of your trust).  Depositary receipts generally
involve the same types of risks as foreign common stock held directly.  Some
depositary receipts may experience less liquidity than the underlying common
stocks traded in their home market.  Certain depositary receipts are unsponsored
(i.e. issued without the participation or involvement of the issuer of the
underlying security).  The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not
obligated to disclose information that may be considered material in the U.S.
Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and,
as a result, there may not be a correlation between certain information
impacting a security and the market value of the depositary receipts.
  
  EMERGING MARKETS.  Your trust and/or certain funds held by your trust may
invest in certain securities issued by entities located in emerging markets.
Emerging markets are generally defined as countries in the initial states of
their industrialization cycles with low per capita income.  The markets of
emerging markets countries are generally more volatile than the markets of
developed countries with more mature economies.  All of the risks of investing
in foreign securities described above are heightened by investing in emerging
markets countries.
  
  SUPRANATIONAL ENTITIES' SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may
invest in obligations issued by supranational entities such as the International
Bank for Reconstruction and


90     Understanding Your Investment


Development (the World Bank).  The government members, or "stockholders,"
usually make initial capital contributions to supranational entities and in many
cases are committed to make additional capital contributions if a supranational
entity is unable to repay its borrowings.  There is no guarantee that one or
more stockholders of a supranational entity will continue to make any necessary
additional capital contributions.  If such contributions are not made, the
entity may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities,
and a fund may lose money on such investments.
  
  SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  Your trust and/or certain funds held by your
trust may invest in securities issued by small and mid-size companies.  The
share prices of these companies are often more volatile than those of larger
companies as a result of several factors common to many such issuers, including
limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management
inexperience and less publicly available information.  In particular, companies
with smaller capitalizations may be less financially secure, depend on a smaller
number of key personnel and generally be subject to more unpredictable price
changes than larger, more established companies and the markets as a whole.
Smaller capitalization and emerging growth companies may be particularly
sensitive to changes in interest rates, borrowing costs and earnings.
  
  BOND QUALITY RISK.  Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in
value if a rating agency decreases or withdraws the bond's rating.
  
  PREPAYMENT RISK.  When interest rates fall, among other factors, the issuer
of a security may prepay their obligations earlier than expected.  Such
prepayments will result in early distributions to a fund holding such security
and such funds may be unable to reinvest such amounts at the yields originally
invested which could adversely impact the funds and the trust.  Certain bonds
held by the funds may include call provisions which expose such funds and your
trust to call risk.  Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a
bond before its stated maturity.  An issuer might call a bond if interest rates,
in general fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer
needs the money for the original purpose.  If an issuer calls a bond, a fund
holding such bond will receive principal but future interest distributions will
fall.  Such fund might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a
yield.  A bond's call price could be less than the price paid for the bond and
could be below the bond's par value.  Certain bonds may also be subject to
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as
certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or
other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and
various other events.
  
  EXTENSION RISK.  When interest rates rise, among other factors, issues of a
security may pay off obligations more slowly than expected causing the value of
such obligations to fall.
  
  MARKET DISCOUNT.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in bonds whose
current market values were below the principal value on the purchase date.  A
primary reason for the market value of such bonds being less than the principal
value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a lower rate than the
current market interest rates for comparable bonds.  Bonds selling at market
discounts tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity.
  
  PREMIUM BONDS.  Certain funds held by the trust may invest in bonds whose
current market values were above the principal value on the purchase date.  A
primary reason for the market value of such bonds being higher than the
principal


                                            Understanding Your Investment     91


value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a higher rate than the
current market interest rates for comparable bonds.  The current returns of
bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns
of comparable bonds issued at currently prevailing interest rates because
premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when
the principal value becomes payable.  Because part of the purchase price is
effectively returned not at maturity but through current income payments, early
redemption of a premium bond at par or any other amount below the purchase price
will result in a reduction in yield.  Redemption pursuant to call provisions
generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at
times when the bonds have a market value that represents a premium over par or,
for original issue discount securities, a premium over the accreted value.
  
  MUNICIPAL BONDS.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in municipal
bonds.  Municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by states or by political
subdivisions or authorities of states.  Municipal bonds are typically designated
as general obligation bonds, which are general obligations of a governmental
entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity, or revenue bonds,
which are payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not
supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.  Municipal bonds are long-term
fixed rate debt obligations that generally decline in value with increases in
interest rates, when an issuer's financial condition worsens or when the rating
on a bond is decreased.  Many municipal bonds may be called or redeemed prior to
their stated maturity, an event which is more likely to occur when interest
rates fall.  In such an occurrence, a fund may not be able to reinvest the money
it receives in other bonds that have as high a yield or as long a maturity.
Many municipal bonds are subject to continuing requirements as to the actual use
of the bond proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from bond
proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal
income taxation.  The market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than
for other securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more
volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with greater
liquidity.  In addition, an issuer's ability to make income distributions
generally depends on several factors including the financial condition of the
issuer and general economic conditions.  Any of these factors may negatively
impact the price of municipal bonds held by a fund and would therefore impact
the price of both the fund shares and your trust units.
  
  SOVEREIGN DEBT.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in sovereign
debt.  Sovereign debt instruments are subject to the risk that a governmental
entity may delay or refuse to pay interest or repay principal on its sovereign
debt, due, for example, to cash flow problems, insufficient foreign currency
reserves, political considerations, the relative size of the governmental
entity's debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to put in place
required economic reforms.  If a governmental entity defaults, it may ask for
more time in which to pay or for further loans.  There is no legal process for
collecting sovereign debt that a government does not pay nor are there
bankruptcy proceedings through which all or part of the sovereign debt that a
governmental entity has not repaid may be collected.
  
  U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS RISK.  Certain funds held by your trust may
invest in obligations of the U.S. Government.  Obligations of U.S. Government
agencies, authorities, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have
historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to


92     Understanding Your Investment


maturity.  However, not all U.S. Government securities are backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States.  Obligations of certain agencies,
authorities, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises of the U.S. Government
are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States (e.g., the
Government National Mortgage Association); other obligations are backed by the
right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., the Federal Home
Loan Banks) and others are supported by the discretionary authority of the U.S.
Government to purchase an agency's obligations.  Still others are backed only by
the credit of the agency, authority, instrumentality or sponsored enterprise
issuing the obligation.  No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government
would provide financial support to any of these entities if it is not obligated
to do so by law.
  
  U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
U.S. Treasury obligations.  U.S. Treasury obligations are direct obligations of
the United States which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States.  The value of U.S. Treasury obligations will be adversely affected by
decreases in bond prices and increases in interest rates.
  
  HIGH YIELD OR "JUNK" SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest
in high yield securities or unrated securities.  High yield, high risk
securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than
securities with higher investment ratings.  The value of these securities will
decline significantly with increases in interest rates, not only because
increases in rates generally decrease values, but also because increased rates
may indicate an economic slowdown.  An economic slowdown, or a reduction in an
issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the issuer being unable to maintain
earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments.
High yield or "junk" securities, the generic names for securities rated below
"BBB" by Standard & Poor's or "Baa" by Moody's, are frequently issued by
corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established
companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are
depressed.  Securities rated below BBB or Baa are considered speculative as
these ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade.  Because high
yield securities are generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by
investors to be riskier than higher rated securities, their prices tend to
fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by short-term
credit developments to a greater degree.  The market for high-yield securities
is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.  High
yield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange but
trade in the over-the-counter markets.  Due to the smaller, less liquid market
for high yield securities, the bid-offer spread on such securities is generally
greater than it is for investment grade securities and the purchase or sale of
such securities may take longer to complete.
  
  SENIOR LOANS.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in senior loans
and similar transactions.  Senior loans are issued by banks, other financial
institutions and other investors to corporations, partnerships, limited
liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts,
recapitalizations, mergers, acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt refinancings
and, to a lesser extent, for general operating and other purposes.  An
investment by the funds in senior loans and similar transactions involves risk
that the borrowers under such transactions may default on their obligations to
pay principal or interest when due.  Although senior loans may be secured by
specific collateral, there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral
would satisfy the borrower's obligation in the event of non-payment or that such


                                            Understanding Your Investment     93


collateral could be readily liquidated.  Senior loans are typically structured
as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the
obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes.  As a result, the yield on
funds investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest
rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.  Senior
loans are generally below investment grade quality and may be unrated at the
time of investment; are generally not registered with the SEC or state
securities commissions; and are generally not listed on any securities exchange.
In addition, the amount of public information available on senior loans is
generally less extensive than that available for other types of securities.
  
  CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
convertible securities.  Convertible securities generally offer lower interest
or dividend yields than non-convertible fixed-income securities of similar
credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation.  The market
values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and,
conversely, to increase as interest rates decline.  However, a convertible
security's market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common
stock of the issuing company, particularly when that stock price is greater than
the convertible security's "conversion price."  The conversion price is defined
as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security
can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock.  As the market
price of the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price, the
price of the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by
the yield of the convertible security.  Thus, it may not decline in price to the
same extent as the underlying common stock.  In the event of a liquidation of
the issuing company, holders of convertible securities would be paid before that
company's common stockholders.  Consequently, an issuer's convertible securities
generally entail less risk than its common stock.  However, convertible
securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference
or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated
lower than such debt obligations.
  
  Mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of convertible
securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion price at
maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common stock,
which may be significantly less than par or the price (above or below par) paid.
For these reasons, the risks associated with investing in mandatory convertible
securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common stocks.  Mandatory
convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield to compensate for
the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss upon conversion.
Because the market price of a mandatory convertible security increasingly
corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock, as the
convertible security approaches its conversion date, there can be no assurance
that the higher coupon will compensate for a potential loss.
  
  FLOATING RATE INSTRUMENTS.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
floating rate securities.  A floating rate security is an instrument in which
the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates on a periodic basis based
upon changes in a benchmark, often related to interest rates.  As a result, the
yield on such a security will generally decline with negative changes to the
benchmark, causing the trust to experience a reduction in the income it receives
from such securities.  A sudden and significant increase in the applicable
benchmark may increase the risk of payment defaults and cause a decline in the
value of the security.


94     Understanding Your Investment


  ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
asset-backed securities ("ABS").  ABS are securities backed by pools of loans or
other receivables.  ABS are created from many types of assets, including auto
loans, credit card receivables, home equity loans, and student loans.  ABS are
issued through special purpose vehicles that are bankruptcy remote from the
issuer of the collateral.  The credit quality of an ABS transaction depends on
the performance of the underlying assets.  To protect ABS investors from the
possibility that some borrowers could miss payments or even default on their
loans, ABS include various forms of credit enhancement.  Some ABS, particularly
home equity loan transactions, are subject to interest rate risk and prepayment
risk.  A change in interest rates can affect the pace of payments on the
underlying loans, which in turn, affects total return on the securities.  ABS
also carry credit or default risk.  If many borrowers on the underlying loans
default, losses could exceed the credit enhancement level and result in losses
to investors in an ABS transaction.  Finally, ABS have structure risk due to a
unique characteristic known as early amortization, or early payout, risk.  Built
into the structure of most ABS are triggers for early payout, designed to
protect investors from losses.  These triggers are unique to each transaction
and can include: a big rise in defaults on the underlying loans, a sharp drop in
the credit enhancement level, or even the bankruptcy of the originator.  Once
early amortization begins, all incoming loan payments (after expenses are paid)
are used to pay investors as quickly as possible based upon a predetermined
priority of payment.
  
  MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
mortgage-backed securities.  Mortgage-backed securities are a type of ABS
representing direct or indirect participations in, or are secured by and payable
from, mortgage loans secured by real property and can include single- and multi-
class pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.
Mortgage-backed securities are based on different types of mortgages, including
those on commercial real estate or residential properties.  These securities
often have stated maturities of up to thirty years when they are issued,
depending upon the length of the mortgages underlying the securities.  In
practice, however, unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest on
the underlying mortgages may make the securities' effective maturity shorter
than this.  Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgage-backed
securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates, and may
reduce the market value of the securities.  In addition, mortgage-backed
securities are subject to prepayment risk, the risk that borrowers may pay off
their mortgages sooner than expected, particularly when interest rates decline.
This can reduce the funds', and therefore your trust's, returns because the
funds may have to reinvest that money at lower prevailing interest rates.
  
  RESTRICTED SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
securities that may only be resold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act of 1933.  Such securities may not be readily marketable.  Restricted
securities may be sold only to purchasers meeting certain eligibility
requirements in privately negotiated transactions or in a public offering with
respect to which a registration statement is in effect under the Securities Act.
Where registration of such securities under the Securities Act is required, a
fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a
considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the
time the fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective
registration statement.  If, during such a period, adverse market conditions
were to develop, the fund might obtain a less favorable price than that which
prevailed when it decided to sell.


                                            Understanding Your Investment     95


  LIQUIDITY RISK.  Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will
fall if trading in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that
a liquid trading market will exist for any security.
  
  COVERED CALL OPTION STRATEGIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest
using covered call option strategies.  You should understand the risks of these
strategies before you invest.  In employing a covered call strategy, a closed-
end fund will generally write (sell) call options on a significant portion of
the fund's managed assets.  These call options will give the option holder the
right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security from the fund at the
strike price on or prior to the option's expiration date.  The ability to
successfully implement the fund's investment strategy depends on the fund
adviser's ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be
assured.  Thus, the use of options may require a fund to sell portfolio
securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values,
may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment, or
may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell.  The writer
(seller) of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to
fulfill its obligation as a writer (seller) of the option.  Once an option
writer (seller) has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a closing
purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and
must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price.  As the writer
(seller) of a covered call option, a fund forgoes, during the option's life, the
opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security
underlying the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of
the call option, but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the
underlying security decline.  The value of the options written (sold) by a fund,
which will be marked-to-market on a daily basis, will be affected by changes in
the value and dividend rates of the underlying securities, an increase in
interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of securities
markets and the underlying securities and the remaining time to the options'
expiration.  The value of the options may also be adversely affected if the
market for the options becomes less liquid or smaller.
  
  An option is generally considered "covered" if a fund owns the security
underlying the call option or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire
that security without additional cash consideration (or, if required, liquid
cash or other assets are segregated by the fund) upon conversion or exchange of
other securities held by the fund.  In certain cases, a call option may also be
considered covered if a fund holds a call option on the same security as the
call option written (sold) provided that certain conditions are met.  By writing
(selling) covered call options, a fund generally seeks to generate income, in
the form of the premiums received for writing (selling) the call options.
Investment income paid by a fund to its shareholders (such as the trust) may be
derived primarily from the premiums it receives from writing (selling) call
options and, to a lesser extent, from the dividends and interest it receives
from the equity securities or other investments held in the fund's portfolio and
short-term gains thereon.  Premiums from writing (selling) call options and
dividends and interest payments made by the securities in a fund's portfolio can
vary widely over time.
  
  PREFERRED SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
preferred securities including preferred stocks, trust preferred securities,
subordinated or junior notes and debentures and other similarly structured
securities.  Preferred securities combine some of the characteristics of common
stocks and bonds.  Preferred securities generally pay fixed or adjustable rate


96     Understanding Your Investment


income in the form of dividends or interest to investors.  Preferred securities
generally have preference over common stock in the payment of income and the
liquidation of a company's assets. However, preferred securities are typically
subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital
structure and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt
instruments.  Because of their subordinated position in the capital structure of
an issuer, the ability to defer dividend or interest payments for extended
periods of time without triggering an event of default for the issuer, and
certain other features, preferred securities are often treated as equity-like
instruments by both issuers and investors, as their quality and value are
heavily dependent on the profitability and cash flows of the issuer rather than
on any legal claims to specific assets.  Most retail-available preferred
securities have a $25 par (or "face") value but can also have par values of $50
or $1,000.  Preferred securities are often callable at their par value at some
point in time after their original issuance date.  Income payments on preferred
securities are generally stated as a percentage of these par values although
certain preferred securities provide for variable or additional participation
payments.
  
  While some preferred securities are issued with a final maturity date, others
are perpetual in nature.  In certain instances, a final maturity date may be
extended and/or the final payment of principal may be deferred at the issuer's
option for a specified time without triggering an event of default for the
issuer.  Preferred securities generally may be subject to provisions that allow
an issuer, under certain conditions, to skip ("non-cumulative" preferred
securities) or defer ("cumulative" preferred securities) distributions.  The
issuer of a non-cumulative preferred security does not have an obligation to
make up any arrearages to holders of such securities and non-cumulative
preferred securities can defer distributions indefinitely.  Cumulative preferred
securities typically contain provisions that allow an issuer, at its discretion,
to defer distributions payments for up to 10 years.  If a preferred security is
deferring its distribution, investors may be required to recognize income for
tax purposes while they are not receiving any income.  In certain circumstances,
an issuer of preferred securities may redeem the securities during their life.
For certain types of preferred securities, a redemption may be triggered by a
change in federal income tax or securities laws.  As with call provisions, a
redemption by the issuer may negatively impact the return of the security.
Preferred security holders generally have no voting rights with respect to the
issuing company except in very limited situations, such as if the issuer fails
to make income payments for a specified period of time or if a declaration of
default occurs and is continuing.  Preferred securities may be substantially
less liquid than many other securities, such as U.S. government securities or
common stock.  The federal income tax treatment of preferred securities may not
be clear or may be subject to recharacterization by the Internal Revenue
Service.  Issuers of preferred securities may be in industries that are heavily
regulated and that may receive government funding.  The value of preferred
securities issued by these companies may be affected by changes in government
policy, such as increased regulation, ownership restrictions, deregulation or
reduced government funding.
  
  Preferred stocks are a category of preferred securities that are typically
considered equity securities and make income payments from an issuer's after-tax
profits that are treated as dividends for tax purposes.  While they generally
provide for specified income payments as a percentage of their par value, these
payments generally do not carry the same set of guarantees


                                            Understanding Your Investment     97


afforded to bondholders and have higher risks of non-payment or deferral.
  
  Certain preferred securities may be issued by trusts or other special purpose
entities established by operating companies, and are therefore not direct
obligations of operating companies.  At the time a trust or special purpose
entity sells its preferred securities to investors, the trust or special purpose
entity generally purchases debt of the operating company with terms comparable
to those of the trust or special purpose entity securities.  The trust or
special purpose entity, as the holder of the operating company's debt, has
priority with respect to the operating company's earnings and profits over the
operating company's common shareholders, but is typically subordinated to other
classes of the operating company's debt.  Distribution payments of trust
preferred securities generally coincide with interest payments on the underlying
obligations.  Distributions from trust preferred securities are typically
treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes and
therefore, are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the lower
federal tax rates applicable to qualified dividends.  Trust preferred securities
generally involve the same risks as traditional preferred stocks but are also
subject to unique risks, including risks associated with income payments only
being made if payments on the underlying obligations are made.  Typically, a
trust preferred security will have a rating that is below that of its
corresponding operating company's senior debt securities due to its subordinated
nature.
  
  Subordinated or junior notes or debentures are securities that generally have
priority to common stock and other preferred securities in a company's capital
structure but are subordinated to other bonds and debt instruments in a
company's capital structure.  As a result, these securities will be subject to
greater credit risk than those senior debt instruments and will not receive
income payments or return of principal in the event of insolvency until all
obligations on senior debt instruments have been made.  Distributions from these
securities are typically treated as interest rather than dividends for federal
income tax purposes and therefore, are not eligible for the dividends-received
deduction or the lower federal tax rates applicable to qualified dividends.
Investments in subordinated or junior notes or debentures also generally involve
risks similar to risks of other preferred securities described above.
  
  REAL ESTATE RELATED SECURITIES.  Your trust and/or certain funds held by the
trust may invest in securities providing exposure to real estate investments.
Risks associated with the ownership of real estate include, among other factors,
changes in general U.S., global and local economic conditions, decline in real
estate values, changes in the financial health of tenants, overbuilding and
increased competition for tenants, oversupply of properties for sale, changing
demographics, changes in interest rates, tax rates and other operating expenses,
changes in government regulations, faulty construction and the ongoing need for
capital improvements, regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating
to liability for environmental hazards, changes in neighborhood values and buyer
demand, and the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at
rates acceptable to developers.
  
  REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS.  Your trust and/or certain funds held by the
trust may invest in securities issued by real estate investment trusts
("REITs").  Many factors can have an adverse impact on the performance of a
REIT, including its cash available for distribution, the credit quality of the
REIT or the real estate industry generally.  The success of a REIT


98     Understanding Your Investment


depends on various factors, including the occupancy and rent levels,
appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents on those
properties.  Economic recession, overbuilding, tax law changes, higher interest
rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact REITs, their future
earnings and share prices.  Variations in rental income and space availability
and vacancy rates in terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting
real estate generally and REITs in particular.  Properties owned by a REIT may
not be adequately insured against certain losses and may be subject to
significant environmental liabilities, including remediation costs.  You should
also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of
financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical, and, if REIT
securities are acquired at or near the top of the cycle, there is increased risk
of a decline in value of the REIT securities.  At various points in time, demand
for certain types of real estate may inflate the value of real estate.  This may
increase the risk of a substantial decline in the value of such real estate and
increase the risk of a decline in the value of the securities.  REITs are also
subject to defaults by borrowers and the market's perception of the REIT
industry generally.  Because of their structure, and a current legal requirement
that they distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders
annually, REITs require frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing
money and issuing stock.  Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued
substantial amounts of new equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build
new properties.  This may adversely affect REIT equity share market prices. Both
existing and new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in
the future, especially if REITs issue stock when real estate prices are
relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.
  
  Mortgage REITs engage in financing real estate, purchasing or originating
mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and earning income from the interest on
these investments. Such REITs face risks similar to those of other financial
firms, such as changes in interest rates, general market conditions and credit
risk, in addition to risks associated with an investment in real estate.
  
  MLPS.  Your trust and/or certain funds held by the trust may invest in master
limited partnerships ("MLPs").  MLPs are limited partnership or limited
liability companies that are generally taxed as partnership whose interests are
generally traded on securities exchanges.  An MLP consists of a general partner
and limited partners.  The general partner manages the partnership, has an
ownership stake in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive
distribution.  The limited partners provide capital to the partnership, have a
limited (if any) role in the operation and management of the partnership and
receive cash distributions.  Unlike stockholders of a corporation, limited
partners do not elect directors annually and generally have the right to vote
only on certain significant events, such as mergers, a sale of substantially all
of the partnership assets, removal of the general partner or material amendments
to the partnership agreement.  Limited partners generally have first right to a
minimum quarterly distribution prior to distributions to the convertible
subordinated unit holders or the general partner (including incentive
distributions) and typically have arrearage rights if the minimum quarterly
distribution is not met.  Most MLPs generally operate in the energy natural
resources or real estate sector and are subject to the risks generally
applicable to companies in those sectors.  Those risks include, but are not
limited to, commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and
exploration risk.  MLPs are also subject to the risk that authorities could
challenge the tax treatment of


                                            Understanding Your Investment     99


MLPs for federal income tax purposes which could have a negative impact on the
after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs and/or the value of your
trust's investments.
  
  DERIVATIVES RISK.  Certain funds held by your trust may engage in
transactions in derivatives.  Derivatives are subject to counterparty risk which
is the risk that the other party in a transaction may be unable or unwilling to
meet obligations when due.  Use of derivatives may increase volatility of a fund
and the trust and reduce returns.  Fluctuations in the value of derivatives may
not correspond with fluctuations of underlying exposures.  Unanticipated market
movements could result in significant losses on derivative positions including
greater losses than amounts originally invested and potentially unlimited losses
in the case of certain derivatives.  There are no assurances that there will be
a secondary market available in any derivative position which could result in
illiquidity and the inability of a fund to liquidate or terminate positions as
valued.  Valuation of derivative positions may be difficult and increase during
times of market turmoil.  Certain derivatives may be used as a hedge against
other securities positions however hedging can be subject to the risk of
imperfect alignment and there are no assurances that a hedge will be achieved as
intended which can pose significant loss to a fund and your trust.  Recent
legislation has called for significant increases to the regulation of the
derivatives market.  Regulatory changes and rulemaking is ongoing and the full
impact may not be known for some time.  This increased regulation may make
derivatives more costly, limit the availability of derivatives or otherwise
adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.  Examples of increased
regulation include, but are not limited to the imposition of clearing and
reporting requirements on transactions that fall within the definition of "swap"
and "security-based swap", increased recordkeeping and reporting requirements,
changing definitional and registration requirements, and changes to the way that
funds' use of derivatives is regulated.  We cannot predict the effects of any
new governmental regulation that may be implemented on the ability of a fund to
use any financial derivative product, and there can be no assurance that any new
governmental regulation will not adversely affect a fund's ability to achieve
its investment objective.  The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may
not be as favorable as a direct investment in the asset that a derivative
provides exposure to which may adversely impact the timing, character and amount
of income a fund realizes from its investment.  The tax treatment of certain
derivatives is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or
administrative pronouncements.
  
  SWAPS.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in swaps.  In addition to
general risks associated with derivatives described above, swap agreements
involve the risk that the party with whom a fund has entered into the swap will
default on its obligation to pay a fund and the risk that a fund will not be
able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.  Swaps
entered into by a fund may include, but are not limited to, interest rate swaps,
total return swaps and/or credit default swaps.  In an interest rate swap
transaction, two parties exchange rights to receive interest payments, such as
exchanging the right to receive floating rate payments based on a reference
interest rate for the right to receive fixed rate payments.  In addition to the
general risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above, interest
rate swaps are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.  In a total return
swap transaction, one party agrees to pay another party an amount equal to the
total return on a reference asset during a specified period of time in


100     Understanding Your Investment


return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or on
the total return from a different reference asset.  In addition to the general
risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above, total return swaps
could result in losses if the reference asset does not perform as anticipated
and these swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses.  In a credit
default swap transaction, one party makes one or more payments over the term of
the contract to the counterparty, provided that no event of default with respect
to a specific obligation or issuer has occurred.  In return, upon any event of
default, such party would receive from the counterparty a payment equal to the
par (or other agreed-upon) value of such specified obligation.  In addition to
general risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above, credit
default swaps involve special risks because they are difficult to value, are
highly susceptible to liquidity and credit risk, and generally pay a return to
the party that has paid the premium only in the event of an actual default by
the issuer of the underlying obligation (as opposed to a credit downgrade or
other indication of financial difficulty).
  
  FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.  Certain funds held by your
trust may may engage in forward foreign currency exchange transactions.  Forward
foreign exchange transactions are contracts to purchase or sell a specified
amount of a specified currency or multinational currency unit at a price and
future date set at the time of the contract.  Forward foreign currency exchange
contracts do not eliminate fluctuations in the value of non-U.S. securities but
rather allow a fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in
time.  This strategy can have the effect of reducing returns and minimizing
opportunities for gain.
  
  INDEXED AND INVERSE SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest
in indexed and inverse securities.  In addition to general risks associated with
derivatives described above, indexed and inverse securities are subject to risk
with respect to the value of the particular index.  These securities are subject
to leverage risk and correlation risk.  Certain indexed and inverse securities
have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates or index levels than other
securities, and a fund's investment in such instruments may decline
significantly in value if interest rates or index levels move in a way a fund's
management does not anticipate.
  
  FUTURES.  Certain funds held by your trust may engage in futures
transactions.  In addition to general risks associated with derivatives
described above, the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts
and options are (a) the imperfect correlation between the change in market value
of the instruments held by a fund and the price of the futures contract or
option; (b) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract
and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired; (c) losses
caused by unanticipated market movements, which are potentially unlimited; (d)
the investment adviser's inability to predict correctly the direction of
securities prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and other economic
factors; and (e) the possibility that the counterparty will default in the
performance of its obligations.  While futures contracts are generally liquid
instruments, under certain market conditions they may become illiquid.  Futures
exchanges may impose daily or intra-day price change limits and/or limit the
volume of trading.  Additionally, government regulation may further reduce
liquidity through similar trading restrictions.
  
  OPTIONS.  Certain funds held by your trust may engage in options
transactions.  In addition to general risks associated with derivatives


                                           Understanding Your Investment     101


described above, options are considered speculative.  When a fund purchases an
option, it may lose the premium paid for it if the price of the underlying
security or other assets decreased or remained the same (in the case of a call
option) or increased or remained the same (in the case of a put option).  If a
put or call option purchased by a fund were permitted to expire without being
sold or exercised, its premium would represent a loss to a fund.  To the extent
that a fund writes or sells an option, if the decline or increase in the
underlying asset is significantly below or above the exercise price of the
written option, a fund could experience substantial and potentially unlimited
losses.
  
  REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RISK.  If the other party to a repurchase agreement
defaults on its obligation under such agreement, a fund may suffer delays and
incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement.  If the
seller fails to repurchase the security under a repurchase agreement and the
market value of such security declines, such fund may lose money.
  
  SHORT SALES RISK.  Certain funds held by your trust may engage in short
sales.  Because making short sales in securities that it does not own exposes a
fund to the risks associated with those securities, such short sales involve
speculative exposure risk.  A fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale
if the price of the security increases between the date of the short sale and
the date on which such fund replaces the security sold short.  A fund will
realize a gain if the security declines in price between those dates.  As a
result, if a fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value, it
will likely underperform similar funds that do not make short sales in
securities they do not own.  There can be no assurance that a fund will be able
to close out a short sale position at any particular time or at an acceptable
price.  Although a fund's gain is limited to the amount at which it sold a
security short, its potential loss is limited only by the maximum attainable
price of the security, less the price at which the security was sold.  Short
sale transactions involve leverage because they can provide investment exposure
in an amount exceeding the initial investment.  A fund may also pay transaction
costs and borrowing fees in connection with short sales.
  
  COMMODITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may have exposure to the
commodities market.  This exposure could expose such funds and the trust to
greater volatility than investment in other securities.  The value of
investments providing commodity exposure may be affected by changes in overall
market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or
factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods,
weather, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory
developments.
  
  MONEY MARKET SECURITIES.  Certain funds held by your trust may invest in
money market securities.  If market conditions improve while a fund has
temporarily invested some or all of its assets in high quality money market
securities, this strategy could result in reducing the potential gain from the
market upswing, thus reducing a fund's opportunity to achieve its investment
objective.
  
  LEGISLATION/LITIGATION.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives
are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on
certain of the securities held by your trust or underlying funds.  In addition,
litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries
represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these
securities.  No one can predict what impact


102     Understanding Your Investment


any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the
securities.
  
  NO FDIC GUARANTEE.  An investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.
  
                                CLOSED-END FUNDS
  
  Closed-end funds are subject to various risks, including management's ability
to meet the closed-end fund's investment objective, and to manage the closed-end
fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold, during
periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions regarding closed-end
funds or their underlying investments change.
  
  Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net
asset value in the secondary market.  This risk is separate and distinct from
the risk that the net asset value of closed-end fund shares may decrease.  The
amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to
time in response to various factors.
  
  Certain of the closed-end funds included in your trust may employ the use of
leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock.  While
leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closed-end fund, this leverage
also subjects the closed-end fund to increased risks.  These risks may include
the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closed-end
fund's common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred
shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises.  The use of leverage may
cause a closed-end fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be
advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset
segregation requirements.
  
  Certain closed-end funds held by your trust may engage in borrowing.
Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of a fund's shares and
in the return on a fund's portfolio.  Borrowing will cost a fund interest
expense and other fees.  The costs of borrowing may reduce a fund's return.
Borrowing may cause a fund to liquidate positions when it may not be
advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.
  
  Certain closed-end funds held by your  trust may engage in securities
lending.  Securities lending involves the risk that the borrower may fail to
return the securities in a timely manner or at all.  As a result, a fund could
lose money and there may be a delay in recovering the loaned securities.  A fund
could also lose money if it does not recover the securities and/or the value of
the collateral falls, including the value of investments made with cash
collateral.  These events could trigger adverse tax consequences for a fund.
  
  Only the trustee may vote the shares of the closed-end funds held in your
trust.  The trustee will vote the shares in the same general proportion as
shares held by other shareholders of each fund.  Your trust may be required,
however, to reject any offer for securities or other property in exchange for
portfolio securities as described under "How the Trust Works--Changing Your
Portfolio."
  
                               HOW THE TRUST WORKS
  
  YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created your trust under a trust agreement
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities
along with an irrevocable letter of credit


                                           Understanding Your Investment     103


or other consideration to pay for the securities).  In exchange, the trustee
delivered units of your trust to us.  Each unit represents an undivided interest
in the assets of your trust.  These units remain outstanding until redeemed or
until your trust terminates.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on
your trust's inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the
public offering price per unit equals $10.  The number of units and fractional
interest of each unit in your trust will increase or decrease to the extent of
any adjustment.
  
  CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will
generally buy and sell securities:
  
  *  to pay expenses,
  
  *  to issue additional units or redeem units,
  
  *  to take actions in response to certain corporate actions and other events
     impacting portfolio securities,
  
  *  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,
  
  *  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust,
     or
  
  *  as permitted by the trust agreement.
  
  When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversification of the
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  If a public tender offer has been
made for a security or a merger, acquisition or similar transaction has been
announced affecting a security, the sponsor may direct the trustee to sell the
security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action
is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any
available cash proceeds to unitholders.
  
  If an offer by the issuer of any of the portfolio securities or any other
party is made to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for trust
portfolio securities, the trustee will reject the offer unless your trust is a
"regulated investment company" for tax purposes (see "Essential Information--Tax
Structure" in the "Investment Summary" section for your trust in this
prospectus).  If your trust is a "regulated investment company" for tax purposes
and an offer by the issuer of any of the portfolio securities or any other party
is made to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for trust portfolio
securities, the trustee may either vote for or against, or accept or reject, any
offer for new or exchanged securities or property in exchange for a trust
portfolio security at the direction of the sponsor.
  
  If any issuance, exchange or substitution of new or exchanged securities or
property in exchange for a trust portfolio security occurs (regardless of any
action or rejection by a trust), any securities and/or property received will be
deposited into the trust and will be promptly sold by the trustee pursuant to
the sponsor's direction, unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such
securities or property.
  
  If any contract for the purchase of securities fails, the sponsor will refund
the cash and sales fee attributable to the failed contract to unitholders on or
before the next distribution date unless substantially all of the moneys held to
cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with
the trust agreement.  If your trust is a "regulated investment company" for tax
purposes, the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if
the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the
opinion of the supervisor, would make retention of the securities detrimental to
the trust.  In such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the


104     Understanding Your Investment


reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the trust's inception date.  The sponsor may also
instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that a portfolio
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a "regulated investment company" for
tax purposes.  Your trust will not participate in rights offerings of closed-end
funds, if any.
  
  We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio to the extent
practicable.  When your trust buys securities, it may pay brokerage or other
acquisition fees.  You could experience a dilution of your investment because of
these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units
and the time your trust buys the securities.  When your trust buys or sells
securities, we may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage
commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with us, your trust or
the trustee.
  
  Pursuant to an exemptive order, your trust may be able to purchase securities
from other trusts that we sponsor when we create additional units.  Your trust
may also be able to sell securities to other trusts that we sponsor to satisfy
unit redemption, pay deferred sales charges or expenses, in connection with
periodic tax compliance or in connection with the termination of your trust.
The exemption may enable each trust to eliminate commission costs on these
transactions.  The price for those securities will be the closing price on the
sale date on the exchange where the securities are principally traded as
certified by us to the trustee.
  
  AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this
agreement.
  
  TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate on the termination date
set forth under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of
this prospectus for your trust.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if
the value of the trust is less than 40% of the original value of the securities
in your trust at the time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust
may create an undue burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of
the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee
will liquidate your trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet
sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of your
trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the
time they were deposited in the trust.  If this happens, we will refund any
sales charge that you paid.
  
  You will receive your final distribution within a reasonable time following
liquidation of all the securities after deducting final expenses.  Your
termination distribution may be less than the price you originally paid for your
units.

prospectus.  AAM is a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties
as sponsor or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate
your trust without a sponsor, or terminate your trust.
  
  We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your
trust.
  
  The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in your trust in
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and
sale of securities, including those held by your trust, and may act as a
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports
and make recommendations on the securities in your trust.  The sponsor or an
affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the
securities in your trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or
director for the issuers of the securities.
  
  THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust with
its principal unit investment trust division offices located at 2 Hanson Place,
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling
the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its
unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some
cases without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and
investors.
  
  HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  These distribution firms each receive part of the sales fee
when they sell units.  During the initial offering period, the broker-dealer
concession or agency commission for broker-dealers and other firms is 1.25% of
the public offering price per unit at the time of the transaction.  The broker-
dealer concession or agency commission is 65% of the sales fee for secondary
market sales.  No broker-dealer concession or agency commission is paid to
broker-dealers, investment advisers or other selling firms in connection with
unit sales in Fee Accounts subject to a Wrap Fee.
  
  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain unit investment
trusts for which AAM acts as sponsor are eligible to receive additional
compensation for volume sales.  The sponsor offers two separate volume
concession structures for certain trusts that are referred to as "Volume
Concession A" and "Volume Concession B."  The trusts offered in this prospectus
are Volume Concession A trusts.  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units
of any Volume Concession A trust are eligible to receive the additional
compensation described below.  Such payments will be in addition to the regular
concessions paid to firms as set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus.


106     Understanding Your Investment


  The additional concession for sales in a calendar month is based on total
initial offering period sales of all Volume Concession A trusts during the 12-
month period through the end of the preceding calendar month as set forth in the
following table:
  
       INITIAL OFFERING PERIOD SALES                  VOLUME

     ---------------------------------------------------------

     $25,000,000 but less than $100,000,000           0.035%
     $100,000,000 but less than $150,000,000          0.050
     $150,000,000 but less than $250,000,000          0.075
     $250,000,000 but less than $1,000,000,000        0.100
     $1,000,000,000 but less than $5,000,000,000      0.125
     $5,000,000,000 but less than $7,500,000,000      0.150
     $7,500,000,000 or more                           0.175
  
  We will pay these amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time
following each calendar month.
  
  The volume concessions will be paid on units of all Volume Concession A
trusts sold in the initial offering period, except as described below.  For a
trust to be eligible for this additional Volume Concession A compensation, the
trust's prospectus must include disclosure related to the additional Volume
Concession A compensation; a trust is not eligible for additional Volume
Concession A compensation if the prospectus for such trust does not include
disclosure related to the additional Volume Concession A compensation.  In
addition, dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of units
which are not subject to a transactional sales charge.  However, such sales will
be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints
for volume concessions subject to the policies of the related selling firm.
Secondary market sales of all unit trusts are excluded for purposes of these
volume concessions.
  
  Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of
the broker-dealer concession or agency commission.  We reserve the right to
change the amount of compensation paid to selling firms from time to time.  Some
broker-dealers and other selling firms may limit the compensation they or their
representatives receive in connection with unit sales.  As a result, certain
broker-dealers and other selling firms may waive or refuse payment of all or a
portion of the regular concession or agency commission and/or volume concession
described above and instruct the sponsor to retain such amounts rather than pay
or allow the amounts to such firm.
  
  We currently may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits,
additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of your
trust and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial
advisors for past sales.  A number of factors are considered in determining
whether to pay these additional amounts.  Such factors may include, but are not
limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary, the
level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its
agents, the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list
and access to an intermediary's personnel.  We may make these payments for
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited to,
expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors, advertising,
sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of
unit sales among an intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf
space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale
of our products.  We make such payments to a substantial majority of
intermediaries that sell our products.  We may also make certain payments to, or
on behalf of,


                                           Understanding Your Investment     107


intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of
facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing or purchasing trading
systems to process unit trades.  Payments of such additional compensation
described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described above, some of
which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an incentive for
financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our products,
including your trust, over other products.  These arrangements will not change
the price you pay for your units.
  
  We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in
part.
  
  We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to
create units.  The amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of
securities into your trust is shown in the "Notes to Portfolio" section for your
trust.
  
                      TAXES--REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES
                                        
  This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of your trust if your trust qualifies as a "regulated investment
company" under federal tax laws.  The tax structure of your trust is set forth
under "Essential Information-Tax Structure" in the "Investment Summary" section
for your trust in this prospectus.
  
  This section is current as of the date of this prospectus.  Tax laws and
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of
the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example, these summaries generally
do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a
broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances.  In addition, this
section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.
  
  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,
and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax
treatment of the assets to be deposited in your trust.  This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.
  
  As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.
  
  TRUST STATUS.  Your trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the federal tax laws.  If your trust qualifies as a regulated
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, your
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.  If your trust invests in a
partnership, an adverse federal income tax audit of that partnership could
result in the trust being required to pay federal income tax or pay a deficiency
dividend (without having received additional cash).
  
  DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's
distributions into three categories, ordinary


108     Understanding Your Investment


income distributions, capital gain dividends and return of capital.  Ordinary
income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate, however, as
further discussed below, certain ordinary income distributions received from
your trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates.  Generally, you will
treat all capital gain dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how
long you have owned your units.  To determine your actual tax liability for your
capital gain dividends, you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss
for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions, as
described below.  In addition, your trust may make distributions that represent
a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to
you.  A return of capital, although not initially taxable to you, will result in
a reduction in the basis in your units and subsequently result in higher levels
of taxable capital gains in the future.  In addition, if the non-dividend
distribution exceeds your basis in your units, you will have long-term or short-
term gain depending upon your holding period.  The tax status of your
distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your
distributions in additional units or receive them in cash.  The income from your
trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not
reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws may
require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had received
them on December 31 of the previous year.  Income from your trust may also be
subject to a 3.8 percent "medicare tax."  This tax generally applies to your net
investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold
amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples filing joint returns
and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.
  
  DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many
dividends received from your trust because the dividends received deduction is
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to
qualifying dividends received by your trust from certain corporations may be
reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.
  
  SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.
  
  CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are
an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain
is generally 20% (15% or 0% for taxpayers with taxable incomes below certain
thresholds).  Some portion of your capital gain dividends may be subject to
higher maximum marginal stated federal income tax rates.  Some portion of your
capital gain dividends may be attributable to the trust's interest in a master
limited partnership which may be subject to a maximum marginal stated federal
income tax rate of 28%, rather than the rates set forth above.  In addition,
capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered
"unrecaptured section 1250 gain" (which may be the case, for example, with some
capital gains attributable to equity interests in real estate investment trusts
that constitute interests in entities treated as real estate investment trusts
for federal income tax purposes) is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of 25%.
In the case of capital


                                           Understanding Your Investment     109


gain dividends, the determination of which portion of the capital gain dividend,
if any, is subject to the 28% tax rate or the 25% tax rate, will be made based
on rules prescribed by the United States Treasury.  Capital gains may also be
subject to the "medicare tax" described above.
  
  Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital
loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received.  The tax rates for
capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the
same as for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital
gains as ordinary income in special situations.
  
  Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a
regulated investment company such as your trust are generally taxed at the same
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are
attributable to qualifying dividends received by your trust itself.
Distributions with respect to shares in real estate investment trusts are
qualifying dividends only in limited circumstances.  Your trust will provide
notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken
into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates.
  
  IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of trust securities when you
redeem units or when your trust terminates.  This distribution will be treated
as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain
or loss, generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the
amount of cash received.  The Internal Revenue Service could however assert that
a loss could not be currently deducted.
  
  ROLLOVERS AND EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust
rolled over into a future trust, the exchange would generally be considered a
sale for federal income tax purposes.
  
  TREATMENT OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Expenses incurred and deducted by your trust
will generally not be treated as income taxable to you.  In some cases, however,
you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income.
You may not be able to deduct some or all of these expenses.
  
  FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.
  
  Investments in Certain Foreign Corporations.   If your trust holds an equity
interest in any "passive foreign investment companies" ("PFICs"), which are
generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual
gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents
and royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in
investments producing such passive income, the trust could be subject to U.S.
federal income tax and


110     Understanding Your Investment


additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to
those equity interests, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to
its unitholders.  Your trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders
any credit or deduction for such taxes.  Your trust may be able to make an
election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences.  In this case,
your trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such
PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it
did not exceed prior increases included in income.  Under this election, your
trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its
distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during
that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution
requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax.
Dividends paid by PFICs are not treated as qualified dividend income.
  
  FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from your trust will be characterized as dividends for federal
income tax purposes (other than dividends which your trust properly reports as
capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However,
distributions received by a foreign investor from your trust that are properly
reported by your trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that your trust
makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met.  Distributions
from your trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interest-related
dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a
short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net short-term capital
gain income received by the trust may not be subject to U.S. federal income
taxes, including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors,
provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are
met.  In addition, distributions in respect of units may be subject to a U.S.
withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-U.S.
financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the U.S.
Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a
jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury and
(ii) certain other non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications
and information about the entity's U.S. owners.  Dispositions of units by such
persons may be subject to such withholding after December 31, 2018. You should
also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and
reporting requirements.
  
                              TAXES--GRANTOR TRUSTS
  
  This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of your trust if your trust is structured as a grantor trust
under the federal tax laws.  The tax structure of your trust is set forth under
"Essential Information-Tax Structure" in the "Investment Summary" section for
your trust in this prospectus.
  
  This section is current as of the date of this prospectus.  Tax laws and
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of
the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example, these summaries generally
do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a
broker/dealer, or other


                                           Understanding Your Investment     111


investor with special circumstances.  In addition, this section does not
describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.
  
  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any
conclusions set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked
to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your trust.  This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.
  
  As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.
  
  ASSETS OF THE TRUST.  Your trust is expected to hold one or more of the
following: (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated
as equity for federal income tax purposes, (ii) equity interests (the "REIT
Shares") in real estate investment trusts ("REITs") that constitute interests in
entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax
purposes, and (iii) shares (the "RIC Shares") in funds qualifying as regulated
investment companies ("RICs") that are treated as interests in regulated
investment companies for federal income tax purposes.
  
  It is possible that your trust will also hold other assets, including assets
that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences
different from or in addition to those described in this section.  All of the
assets held by your trust constitute the "Trust Assets."  Neither our counsel
nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets
and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the
federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.
  
  TRUST STATUS.  The trust is considered a grantor trust under federal income
tax laws.  In grantor trusts, investors are deemed for federal income tax
purposes, to own the underlying assets of the trust directly.  All taxability
issues are taken into account at the unit owner level.  Income passes through to
unit owners as realized by the trust.
  
  Income is reported gross of expenses.  Expenses are separately reported based
on a percentage of distributions.  Generally, the cash received by unit owners
is the net of income and expenses reported.
  
  The grantor trust structure is a widely held fixed investment trust
("WHFIT"), and falls under what is commonly referred to as the WHFIT
regulations.
  
  If your trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents
establishing your trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are
met, your trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes.  As a unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any)
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets.  This is true even if you elect to have
your distributions reinvested into additional units.  In addition, the income
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses.
Income from the trust may also be subject to a 3.8 percent "medicare tax."  This
tax generally applies to your net investment income if your adjusted gross
income


112     Understanding Your Investment


exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married
couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.
Interest that is excluded from gross income, including exempt-interest dividends
from any RIC Shares held by the trust, are generally not included in your net
investment income for purposes of this tax.
  
  YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION.  If your trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss.  If you dispose of
your units or redeem your units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss.  To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount
received in the transaction.  You can generally determine your initial tax basis
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your units, including sales
charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date
you acquire your units.  In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units (for example, in the case of
certain dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits,
or in the case of certain distributions with respect to any REIT Shares that
represent a return of capital, as discussed below).
  
  If you are an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for
net capital gain is generally 20% (15% or 0% for taxpayers with taxable incomes
below certain thresholds).  Some capital gains, including some portion of the
capital gain dividends from the RIC Shares, may be taxed at a higher stated
federal tax rate.  Some portion of any capital gain dividends you receive might
be attributable to a RIC's interest in a master limited partnership which may be
subject to a maximum marginal stated federal income tax rate of 28%, rather than
the rates set forth above.  In addition, capital gain received from assets held
for more than one year that is considered "unrecaptured section 1250 gain"
(which may be the case, for example, with some capital gains attributable to
equity interests in real estate investment trusts that constitute interests in
entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax
purposes) is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of 25%.  In the case of capital
gain dividends, the determination of which portion of the capital gain dividend,
if any, is subject to the 28% tax rate or the 25% tax rate, will be made based
on rules prescribed by the United States Treasury.  Capital gains may also be
subject to the "medicare tax" described above.
  
  Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital
gains as ordinary income in special situations.
  
  DIVIDENDS FROM STOCKS.  Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
held by the trust, if any, may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply
to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain holding period
requirements are satisfied.
  
  DIVIDENDS FROM RIC SHARES AND REIT SHARES.  Some dividends on REIT Shares or
RIC Shares, if any, held by the trust, may be reported by the REIT or RIC as
"capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term capital gains.
Some dividends on RIC Shares may qualify as "exempt-interest dividends," which
generally are excluded

from your gross income for federal income tax purposes.  Some or all of the
exempt-interest dividends, however may be taken into account in determining your
alternative minimum tax, and may have other tax consequences (e.g., they may
affect the amount of your social security benefits that are taxed).  Other
dividends on the REIT Shares or the RIC Shares will generally be taxable to you
as ordinary income.  Certain ordinary income dividends from a RIC may qualify to
be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above),
provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the
dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the RIC itself.
Regulated investment companies are required to provide notice to their
shareholders of the amount of any distribution that may be taken into account as
a dividend that is eligible for the capital gains tax rates.  In limited
circumstances, some of the ordinary income dividends from a REIT may also
qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gains.  If you
hold a unit for six months or less or if your trust holds a RIC Share or REIT
Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the
disposition of such RIC Share or REIT Share will be disallowed to the extent of
the exempt-interest dividends you received.  To the extent, if any, it is not
disallowed, it will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to have been received)
with respect to such RIC Share or REIT Share.  Distributions of income or
capital gains declared on the REIT Shares or the RIC Shares in October, November
or December will be deemed to have been paid to you on December 31 of the year
they are declared, even when paid by the REIT or the RIC during the following
January. Some dividends on the REIT Shares may be eligible for a deduction for
qualified business income.
  
  DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  Generally, a domestic corporation owning units
in a trust may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to
such unit owner's pro rata portion of certain types of dividends received by the
trust.  However, a corporation generally will not be entitled to the dividends
received deduction with respect to dividends from most foreign corporations or
from REITs or RICs.  However, certain dividends on RIC Shares that are
attributable to dividends received by the RIC itself from certain domestic
corporations may be reported by the RIC as being eligible for the dividends
received deduction.
  
  IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances as described in this
prospectus, you may request an In-Kind Distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your units or at your trust's termination.  By electing to receive an In-
Kind Distribution, you will receive Trust Assets plus, possibly, cash.  You will
not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust Assets in exchange
for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Trust Assets held
by your trust.  However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset
or a fractional portion of a Trust Asset, you will generally recognize gain or
loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax
basis in such Trust Asset or fractional portion.
  
  ROLLOVERS AND EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust
rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax
purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any
loss will be treated as a capital loss.  However, any loss you incur in
connection with the exchange of your units of your trust for units of the next
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and
subsequent deemed repurchase,


114     Understanding Your Investment


to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical Trust Assets under the
wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
  
  TREATMENT OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Generally, for federal income tax purposes, you
must take into account your full pro rata share of your trust's income, even if
some of that income is used to pay trust expenses.  You may deduct your pro rata
share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly
paid the expense.  You may not be able to deduct some or all of these expenses.
  
  If any of the RICs pay exempt-interest dividends, which are treated as tax-
exempt interest for federal income tax purposes, you will not be able to deduct
some of your share of the trust expenses.  In addition, you will not be able to
deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or continue to
purchase or carry your units.
  
  FOREIGN INVESTORS, TAXES AND INVESTMENTS.  Distributions by your trust that
are treated as U.S. source income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of
domestic corporations) will generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and
withholding in the case of units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign
corporations or other non- U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty.  If
you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or
resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be
subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some or
all of the income from your trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of
your units, provided that certain conditions are met.  You should consult your
tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt
for U.S. tax purposes.  Distributions in respect of units may be subject to a
U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-U.S.
financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the U.S.
Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a
jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury and
(ii) certain other non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications
and information about the entity's U.S. owners.  Dispositions of units by such
persons may be subject to such withholding after December 31, 2018.  You should
also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and
reporting requirements.
  
  Some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you.  Under the grantor
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign
taxes that are paid.  Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.
  
  Under certain circumstances, a RIC may elect to pass through to its
shareholders certain foreign taxes paid by the RIC.  If a RIC makes this
election with respect to RIC Shares, you must include in your income for federal
income tax purposes your portion of such taxes and you may be entitled to a
credit or deduction for such taxes.
  
  If any U.S. investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly 10 percent
or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and
all U.S. shareholders of that corporation collectively own more than 50 percent
of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation, the foreign corporation
may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation (CFC).  If you own 10 percent
or more of a CFC (through your trust and in combination with your other
investments) or possibly if your trust owns 10 percent or more


                                           Understanding Your Investment     115


of a CFC, you will be required to include certain types of the CFC's income in
your taxable income for federal income tax purposes whether or not such income
is distributed to your trust or to you.
  
  A foreign corporation will generally be treated as a passive foreign
investment company ("PFIC") if 75 percent or more of its income is passive
income or if 50 percent or more of its assets are held to produce passive
income.  If your trust purchases shares in a PFIC, you may be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on a portion of certain distributions or on gains from the
disposition of such shares at rates that were applicable in prior years and any
gain may be recharacterized as ordinary income that is not eligible for the
lower net capital gains tax rate.  Additional charges in the nature of interest
may also be imposed on you.  Certain elections may be available with respect to
PFICs that would limit these consequences.  However, these elections would
require you to include certain income of the PFIC in your taxable income even if
not distributed to the trust or to you, or require you to annually recognize as
ordinary income any increase in the value of the shares of the PFIC, thus
requiring you to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in excess of
your actual distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC
stock during a particular year.  Dividends paid by PFICs are not eligible to be
taxed at the net capital gains tax rate.
  
  NEW YORK TAX STATUS.  Under the existing income tax laws of the State and
City of New York, your trust will not be taxed as a corporation subject to the
New York state franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax.  You
should consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local
taxation with respect to your units.
  
                                    EXPENSES
  
  Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section for each trust in this prospectus shows the estimated
amount of these expenses.
  
  The sponsor will receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions.  This "creation and
development fee" is a charge of $0.05 per unit.  The trustee will deduct this
amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial offering period.
No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as
compensation for sales efforts.  This fee will not be deducted from proceeds
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of units before the close of
the initial public offering period.
  
  Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.
  
  Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),
various governmental charges, fees for


116     Understanding Your Investment


extraordinary trustee services, costs of taking action to protect your trust,
costs of indemnifying the trustee and the sponsor, legal fees and expenses,
expenses incurred in contacting you and any applicable license fee for the use
of certain service marks, trademarks and/or trade names.  Your trust may pay the
costs of updating its registration statement each year.  The trustee will
generally pay trust expenses from distributions received on the securities but
in some cases may sell securities to pay trust expenses.
  
                                     EXPERTS
  
  LEGAL MATTERS.  Chapman and Cutler LLP acts as counsel for your trust and has
given an opinion that the units are validly issued.  Dorsey & Whitney LLP acts
as counsel for the trustee.

Opinion on the financial statements

We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition, including
the trust portfolio on pages 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 21, 25, 26, 29,
35, 36, 40, 41, 42, 46, 47, 53, 54, 55, 59, 60, 65, 66, 67, 68, 73 and 77, of
Advisors Disciplined Trust 1889 (the "Trust") as of August 20, 2018, the initial
date of deposit, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements").  In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of
August 20, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

Basis for opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Advisors Asset Management,
Inc., the Sponsor.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's
financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  The Trust is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting.  As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  Our procedures
included confirmation of cash or irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the
purchase of securities as shown in the statements of financial condition as of
August 20, 2018 by correspondence with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the closing sale price
     evaluations as determined by the evaluator.

(2)  Cash or an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited with the trustee
     covering the funds necessary for the purchase of securities in each trust
     represented by purchase contracts.

(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount sufficient to
     pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the trusts.
     These costs have been estimated at $0.049 per unit for the Advisors Core
     Equity Strategy Portfolio, Blue Chip Portfolio, Dividend Advantage
     Portfolio, Dividend Sustainability Portfolio, Energy Opportunities
     Portfolio, European Select Portfolio, International High 30 Dividend
     Portfolio, Minimum Volatility Equity Income Portfolio, Strategic
     Foundations of Growth Portfolio and Ubiquitous Strategy Portfolio - 15
     Month and $0.038 per unit for the Bahl & Gaynor Income Growth Portfolio,
     The Dow(R) Value Ten Portfolio, Strategic High 80 Dividend Portfolio and
     Tactical Plus Closed-End Portfolio - 15 Month.  A distribution will be made
     as of the earlier of the close of the initial offering period or six months
     following the trust's inception date to an account maintained by the
     trustee from which this obligation of the investors will be satisfied.  To
     the extent the actual organization costs are greater than the estimated
     amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the public offering
     price will be reimbursed to the sponsor and deducted from the assets of the
     trust.

(4)  The total sales fee consists of an initial sales fee, a deferred sales fee
     and a creation and development fee.  The initial sales fee is equal to the
     difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining
     deferred sales fee and the total creation and development fee.  The maximum
     sales fee is 1.85% of the public offering price per unit.  The deferred
     sales fee is equal to $0.135 per unit and the creation and development fee
     is equal to $0.05 per unit.

(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable sales fee assuming
     no reduction of sales fees.
